## Upgrading from version 2.* to version 3.*

If you're migrating the StepEngine module from version 2 to version 3, you need to follow the steps described below.
In Version 3 the `StepCollectionInterface::getPreviousStep()` has a new second optional argument (`AbstractTransfer $dataTransfer`). If you use this interface for your own implementation, you need to update your derived class.
If `StepEngineInterface::getTemplateVariables()` is overridden in your project, you need to update the call to `StepCollectionInterface::getPreviousStep()` here as well.
