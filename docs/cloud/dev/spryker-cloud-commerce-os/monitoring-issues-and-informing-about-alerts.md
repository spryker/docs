Every Spryker cloud environment is monitored by the monitoring systems and a dedicated 24/7 team that ensures that environments run stable. In case of problems, this team takes action autonomously or inform you if there is a need for further action on their side. This document explains in details how monitoring and alerting works on Spryker PaaS.

## What is monitored?

The following alerts are configured by default for all environments.

## In what cases do we contact you?

Most of the alerts that we receive are temporary states and do not constitute a real problem. However, there are alert patterns that require us to take action. Here we differentiate between acutely critical issues in production environments and staging or test environments. We focus on critical infrastructure problems in the production environments.

If there is an alert, the monitoring team looks for a likely explanation, like a temporary deployment error. If the alert requires an action, the team decides if it requires consent or cooperation from your side. If cooperation or consent is needed, they will contact the responsible person by opening an alert case. If a Solution Partner is responsible, you can track the status of these alert cases and the tickets in the Partner Portal. We update them on a daily basis in the Case Detail view under Ticket Status.

If it is possible to resolve the problem on our own, we solve it. In case of  downtime or severe service degradation, we inform you about the incident via a case and a Root Cause Analysis [RCA] report.

To sum up, we proactively inform you about infrastructure issues where your collaboration is necessary. In case of an emergency, we keep you in the loop by sharing our diagnosis, options for action, and after the issue is resolved, a root cause analysis.
