The Spryker Commerce OS is an end-to-end solution for digital commerce. This document contains a business-level description of new features and enhancements.

For information about installing the Spryker Commerce OS, see [Getting started guide](/docs/dg/dev/development-getting-started-guide.html).

## Spryker Commerce OS

This section describes the new features released for Spryker Commerce OS.

### [Spryker SDK] Performance Tracing Toolbar <span class="inline-img">![feature](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/feature.png)</span>

Trace your request execution flow to find bottlenecks and optimize your code. The developer toolbar has a new section now, allowing engineers to easily activate the request tracing and examine the whole request flow to find bottlenecks and build performant and optimal code.

![request-tracing](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202307.0/release-notes-202307.0.md/request-tracing.png)

**Business benefit**: Lower response time, faster end-user experience resulting in higher conversion rates.

#### Documentation

[Integrate profiler module](/docs/dg/dev/integrate-and-configure/Integrate-profiler-module.html#prerequisites)

### [Spryker Code Upgrader] Upgrader Compliance Evaluator <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

Make sure your code is compliant and simple to upgrade with Spryker Code Upgrader. This tool allows your team to evaluate your project code and highlight potential issues. Fixing these issues simplifies your upgrading experience.

* [Detecting dead code](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/keeping-a-project-upgradable/upgradability-guidelines/dead-code-checker.html): Reducing dead code is important for maintenance and upgrade because otherwise, your teams invest time in maintaining the code that is not used.
* [Security checker](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/keeping-a-project-upgradable/upgradability-guidelines/spryker-security-checker.html): We let you know about known vulnerabilities in third-party packages so that your team keeps them up-to-date.
* [Minimal version check](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/keeping-a-project-upgradable/upgradability-guidelines/minimum-allowed-shop-version.html): Spryker Code Upgrader is available for customers from SCOS version 2022.04.
* [PHP versions check](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/keeping-a-project-upgradable/upgradability-guidelines/php-version.html): We verify that you use the same version of PHP in composer.json, deploy*.yml, and your runtime to maintain consistency and prevent possible incompatibilities when installing dependencies. For instance, if you are using PHP 8.1 during development or upgrades, but your production system is running on PHP 7.4. Additionally, we check for the minimal PHP version, which is PHP 7.4. Keep in mind that the minimal version will be upgraded to 8.0 in the future, as 7.4 has reached its end of life.

These are the structural code validator of dependency providers:

* [Additional logic in dependency provider](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/keeping-a-project-upgradable/upgradability-guidelines/additional-logic-in-dependency-provider.html): From an architectural standpoint, dependency providers must contain no business logic. Otherwise, the dependency providers are harder to maintain.
* [Flatter arrays in dependency providers](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/keeping-a-project-upgradable/upgradability-guidelines/multidimensional-array.html): It is recommended to have flat arrays of plugins in dependency providers, as it simplifies the upgrade process.
* [Simple plugin instantiation in dependency providers](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/keeping-a-project-upgradable/upgradability-guidelines/multidimensional-array.html): Plugins should be easy to instantiate and have minimal injected dependencies. Otherwise, the leakage of business logic into dependency providers makes maintenance more complex.

Example of the violation report:
```bash
=================
DEAD CODE CHECKER
=================

Message: The class "Pyz/Zed/Single/Communication/Plugin/SinglePlugin" is not used in the project.
Target:  Pyz/Zed/Single/Communication/Plugin/SinglePlugin
```

**Business benefit**: Easier upgrades, fewer security risks, and higher awareness of known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

#### Documentation

[Payone integration in the Back Office](/docs/pbc/all/payment-service-provider/202307.0/third-party-integrations/payone/integration-in-the-back-office/payone-integration-in-the-back-office.html)

### [ACP Foundation] Monitoring and Logging for SCCOS <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

ACP tenant monitoring and logging are required to oversee all ACP-related transactions within Spryker Cloud Commerce OS (SCCOS) properly.

Spryker is providing this feature as an integral part of having an end-to-end monitoring and logging system in place for all ACP app-related actions within SCOS.

This feature works out of the box; no additional configuration is required.

**Business benefit**: Ensure the stability and monitoring of your transactions when using ACP apps.

### [Framework] GlueApplication as API enabler infrastructure <span class="inline-img">![feature](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/feature.png)</span>

Glue as an API stays the same, but the main module carrying the infrastructure for our API development layer gets a complete rework as the GlueApplication module transforms from a Storefront-specific JSON:API complying API provider to an infrastructure that allows the development of different API applications. The applications now follow two separate types: Storefront and backend, which have access to different storage engines that allow for different use cases and get deployed in two different types of containers. The Storefront type has access to Redis & Search storages which allow for quick horizontal scalability to support bursts of traffic. The backend type has direct access to Zed application layer facades, which allow APIs to be built on top of the core business logic.

**Business benefit**: The separation of API applications by type and functionality allows for more diversity in how we design APIs and the exposure of business logic to consumers.

### [Framework] Configure OAuth 2.0 clients on install <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

Previously, OAuth 2.0 clients were not able to be updated other than having one client per installation. To begin, our client was our own Storefront, but when opening the consuming of APIs, we had to allow more API consumer clients to be installed in the system. This feature allows for creating as many OAuth 2.0 clients as needed for consumers.

**Business benefit**:

Allows for the creation of multiple OAuth 2.0 clients, so the business can allow for secure connection of multiple API consumers with different access rights.

#### Documentation

[Install the Customer Account Management feature](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{site.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-features/install-the-customer-account-management-feature.html)

### [Framework] Catalog Back Office Performance Improvements <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

Searching our tables in the back office can cause serious pain for business users that are trying to search any large tables due to how our querying works on the database in the back office. We allowed now for the possibility for our customers to decide on specific tables to allow a more strict yet performant search on specific columns in tables.

**Business benefit**: If a business user has a specific need for faster search on product SKUs or prices or something that contains a large amount of data, a quick configuration in code can help allow for strict yet more performant search

#### Documentation

[Create and configure Zed tables](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed-ui-tables/create-and-configure-zed-tables.html)

### [Framework] Replace Swift Mailer / Swift Mailer library <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

We have been dependant on a deprecated library, Swift Mailer, in our email-sending library. This has been reworked to allow the usage of the more up-to-date [Symfony Mailer](https://github.com/symfony/mailer) component.

**Business benefit**: Jumping to a more widely used and supported component allows customers higher maintainability and feature richness.
