If the execution of Spryker Code Upgrader returns a Composer timeout error, make sure that your access token is still valid. It may be expired or have incorrect permissions.

## Error

Similar to the following:

```shell
The process ... exceeded the timeout of ... seconds.
```

Check that your access token is still active and has correct permissions. For token requirements, see one of the following documents:
