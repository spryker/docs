Depending on your Unzer credentials type defined in the Back Office, the display of the payment method follows a specific logic.

## Standard type credentials

Whenever a customer goes through the checkout process, Unzer is called to know all the payment methods that are currently enabled in your account. This list is compared against the active payment methods for this store. All payment methods that are at the intersection of the Unzer data and the Spryker data are displayed.

## Marketplace type credentials

Whenever a customer goes through the checkout process, Unzer is called to know all the payment methods that are currently enabled in your account. This list is compared against the active payment methods for this store and all the payment methods enabled for all the merchants inside the cart (defined in Unzer).

### Single merchant inside the cart

All payment methods enabled for a marketplace business model in Unzer are displayed:

* Credit Card
* Sofort
* Unzer Bank Transfer

We display all the payment methods enabled for the merchant that are not yet compatible with a marketplace business model.
