This document shows how to add a new shipment method without integrating with the shipment provider.

This document considers the case when you need to add a new shipment method without integrating it with the shipment providers system.

{% info_block infoBox "Note" %}

In this situation, you *must* have multi-currency prices attached to the shipment method and the correct tax set linked to it. Also, the `ship` event *must* be manually triggerable from the Back Office.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Set up the state machine

The state machine that handles orders that use this shipment method needs to use a manual event for shipping so that it can be triggered from the Zed Admin UI.

The corresponding XML for this transition would be as follows:

```xml
<states>
   <state name="exported" reserved="true"/>
   <state name="shipped" reserved="true"/>
//..
</states>
<transitions>
    <transition happy="true">
        <source>exported</source>
        <target>shipped</target>
        <event>ship</event>
    </transition>
//..
</transitions>
<events>
    <event name="ship" manual="true"/>
//..
</events>
```
