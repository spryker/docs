You can always disconnect the Bazaarvoice app from your store. For example, after the trial period, you might decide not to continue with the app. 

Disconnecting the app removes the Bazaarvoice UGC and automatically restores the default Spryker [Product Ratings and Reviews](/docs/scos/user/features/{{site.version}}/product-rating-and-reviews-feature-overview.html) feature.

To disconnect the Bazaarvoice app from your store, do the following

1. In your store's Back Office, go to **Apps&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Catalog**. 
2. Click **Bazaarvoice**.
3. On the Bazaarvoice app details page, next to the **Configure** button, hold the pointer over <span class="inline-img"><img src="https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/aop/user/apps/bazzarvoice/disconnect-button.png"></span> and click **Disconnect**. 
4. In the message that appears, click **Disconnect**. This removes the Bazaarvoice configurations from the Back Office and Storefront.
