In the B2B partnership, which is usually based on contracts, the selling company is also referred to as a merchant, and the buyer is often represented by a business unit of a buying company. In the Spryker B2B shop system, the merchant relation entity is used to connect merchants and buyers together.

There are three key figures: marketplace owner, merchant, and buyer.

* The marketplace owner owns the platform and acts as a broker between merchants and buyers.
* The merchants are sellers usually represented by a [company](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/company-account-feature-overview/company-accounts-overview.html#company).
* The buyers are often [business units](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/company-account-feature-overview/business-units-overview.html) of companies that purchase products or services from the merchants.

The business relationships between merchants and buyers are usually based on contracts.

A Back Office user can create merchants and merchant relations. See [Create merchants](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/create-merchants.html) and [Create merchant relations](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/create-merchant-relations.html) to learn how to do that.

A developer can also import merchants and merchant relations.
