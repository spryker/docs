The Product Information Management (PIM) capability lets you build a rich product catalog using flexible management tools.

The capability consists of a base shop and the marketplace addon. The base shop features are needed to run a regular shop, in which your company is the only entity fulfilling orders. The marketplace addon adds the marketplace product entity, which is product sold by a merchant. To run a marketplace, the features from both the base shop and the marketplace addon are required.
