The document describes the flow of making a product searchable and displayed on the Storefront.

There are a number of conditions that must be fulfilled to make your product searchable and shown on Yves by URL. Ensure your product meets the following conditions:

* Product abstract is assigned to at least one category. For information about how to assign products to categories, see the [Category](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/manage-in-the-back-office/category/assign-products-to-categories.html) section.
* The product abstract's status is `Active`. To learn how to manage products, including the status change, see the [Products](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/manage-in-the-back-office/products/manage-products.html#activating-products) section.
* Product abstract has been marked as searchable in the Back Office. For more details, see the [Products](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/manage-in-the-back-office/products/manage-product-variants/create-product-variants.html) section.
* Product abstract has at least one product variant and the status is `Active`: an abstract product isn't displayed on Yves unless it has product variants. To learn how to create product variants, [Products](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/manage-in-the-back-office/products/manage-product-variants/create-product-variants.html).
* Active product variant is available for the current store. To learn how to check products' availability, see the [Availability](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/availability/managing-products-availability.html) section.
* Product abstract and active variant have a price in the current locale. For more details, see the [Product Prices](/docs/pbc/all/price-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/prices-feature-overview/prices-feature-overview.html) section.
* Product abstract has localized attributes. For the current locale, see the [Edit product attributes](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/attributes/edit-product-attributes.html) section.
