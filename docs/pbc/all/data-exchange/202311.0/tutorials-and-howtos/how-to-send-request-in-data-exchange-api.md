This document describes how to send interact with databases using the Data Exchange API. The Data Exchange API lets you configure endpoints to interact with any database tables. In this document, we are using the `/dynamic-data/countries` to interact with the `spy_country` table as an example.


## Prerequisites

* [Install the Data Exchange API](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/data-exchange-api-integration.html)
* [Configure the Data Exchange API](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/data-exchange-api/how-to-guides/how-to-configure-data-exchange-api.html)


The Data Exchange API is a non-resource-based API and routes all specified endpoints directly to a controller. By default, all routes within the Data Exchange API are protected to ensure data security. To access the API, you need to obtain an access token by sending the `POST /token/` request with the appropriate credentials:

```bash
POST /token/ HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: application/json
Content-Length: 67

grant_type=password&username={username}&password={password}
```

## Retrieve a collection of fields

To retrieve a collection of countries, you need to send the `GET https://glue.mysprykershop.com/dynamic-entity/countries` request. The request needs to include the necessary headers, such as Content-Type, Accept, and Authorization, with the access token provided.

Pagination allows for efficient data retrieval by specifying the desired range of results. To use pagination, include the desired page limit and offset in the request:

```bash
GET /dynamic-entity/countries?page[offset]=1&page[limit]=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
      {
          "id_country": 2,
          "iso2_code": "AD",
          "iso3_code": "AND",
          "name": "Andorra",
          "postal_code_mandatory": true,
          "postal_code_regex": "AD\\d{3}"
      },
      {
          "id_country": 3,
          "iso2_code": "AE",
          "iso3_code": "ARE",
          "name": "United Arab Emirates",
          "postal_code_mandatory": false,
          "postal_code_regex": null
      }
  ]
}
```

The response contains all the columns from the `spy_country` table that are configured in `spy_dynamic_entity_definition.definition`. Each column is represented using the `fieldVisibleName` as the key, providing a comprehensive view of the table's data in the API response. By default the API `GET` request returns up to 20 records.


Filtering enables targeted data retrieval, refining the response to match the specified criteria. To apply filtering to the results based on specific fields, include the appropriate filter parameter in the request:  

```bash
GET /dynamic-entity/countries?filter[country.iso2_code]=AA HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id_country": 1,
      "iso2_code": "AA",
      "iso3_code": "UUD",
      "name": "Create",
      "postal_code_mandatory": false,
      "postal_code_regex": null
    }
  ]
}
```
{% info_block infoBox %}

When you combine multiple filters in a single request, the system applies an `AND` condition to the retrieved results.

{% endinfo_block %}

To retrieve a country by a specific ID, send a `GET` request with the following parameters:

```bash
GET /dynamic-entity/countries/3 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data":[
    {
      "id_country": 3,
      "iso2_code": "AE",
      "iso3_code": "ARE",
      "name": "United Arab Emirates",
      "postal_code_mandatory": false,
      "postal_code_regex": null
    }
  ]
}
```


If you send a request to an endpoint that's not configured in `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration`, the following is returned:

```json
[
    {
        "message": "Not found",
        "status": 404,
        "code": "007"
    }
]
```


## Sending `POST` requests

To create a collection of countries, submit the following HTTP request:

```bash
POST /dynamic-entity/countries HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 154

{
    "data": [
        {
            "iso2_code": "WA",
            "iso3_code": "WWA",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
    ]
}
```

The response payload includes all the specified fields from the request body, along with the ID of the created entity. Response sample:

```json
{
  "data":[
    {
      "iso2_code": "WA",
      "iso3_code": "WWA",
      "name": "FOO",
      "id_country": 257
    }
  ]
}
```


All fields included in the request payload are marked as `isCreatable: true` in the configuration. So, the API creates a new record with all the provided fields.
However, if any of the provided fields are configured as `isCreatable: false`, the request results in an error.

For example, configure `isCreatable: false` for `iso3_code` and send the same request. You should receive the following error response:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Modification of immutable field `iso3_code` is prohibited.",
    "status": 400,
    "code": "1304"
  }
]
```


Certain database-specific configurations may result in issues independent of entity configurations. For example, with MariaDB, it is impossible to set the ID value for an auto-incremented field. Additionally, the `iso2_code` field in the `spy_country` table must have a unique value. Therefore, before creating a new record, you need to make sure you are not passing a duplicate value for this field. If a duplicate value is passed, the following is returned:

```json
[
    {
        "message": "Failed to persist the data. Please verify the provided data and try again. Entry is duplicated.",
        "status": 400,
        "code": "1309"
    }
]
```

This response is caused by a caught Propel exception, specifically an integrity constraint violation: `(Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry 'WA' for key 'spy_country-iso2_code')`.



### Sending `PATCH` requests

To update a collection of countries, submit the following HTTP request:

```bash
PATCH /dynamic-entity/countries HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 174
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id_country": 1,
            "iso2_code": "WB",
            "iso3_code": "WWB",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
    ]
}
```

The response payload includes all the specified fields from the request body. Response sample:

```json
{
    "data":[
      {
        "iso2_code": "WB",
        "iso3_code": "WWB",
        "name": "FOO",
        "id_country": 1
      }
    ]
}
```


To update a specific country, send the following HTTP request:

```bash
PATCH /dynamic-entity/countries/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 143
{
    "data": {
            "iso2_code": "WB",
            "iso3_code": "WWB",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
}
```

All fields included in the request payload are marked as `isCreatable: true` in the configuration. So, the API creates a new record with all the provided fields.
However, if any of the provided fields are configured as `isCreatable: false`, the request results in an error.

For example, configure `isCreatable: false` for `iso3_code` and send the same request. You should receive the following error response:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Modification of immutable field `iso3_code` is prohibited.",
    "status": 400,
    "code": "1304"
  }
]
```



If `id_country` is not provided, the following is returned:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Incomplete Request - missing identifier.",
    "status": 400,
    "code": "1310"
  }
]
```

If `id_country` is not found, the following is returned:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "The entity could not be found in the database.",
    "status": 404,
    "code": "1303"
  }
]
```


{% info_block infoBox %}

Similarly to the `POST` request, it is important to consider database-specific configurations when sending a `PATCH` request.

{% endinfo_block %}

### Sending `PUT` request

When you send a PUT request, you provide the updated representation of the resource in the request payload. The server replaces the entire existing resource with the new representation provided. If the resource does not exist at the specified URL, the request creates a new resource.

To replace an existing entity, send the following `PUT` request:

```bash
PUT /dynamic-entity/countries HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 263
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id_country": 1,
            "iso2_code": "WB",
            "iso3_code": "WWB",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
    ]
}
```

The response payload includes all touched fields for the provided resource. Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "iso2_code": "WB",
      "iso3_code": "WWB",
      "name": "FOO",
      "postal_code_mandatory": null,
      "postal_code_regex": null,
      "id_country": 1
    }
  ]
}
```


It is also possible to send a `PUT` request for a specific ID instead of a collection using the following request:

```bash
PUT /dynamic-entity/countries/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 143
{
    "data": {
            "iso2_code": "WB",
            "iso3_code": "WWB",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
}
```

{% info_block infoBox %}

When using `PUT` requests, it's important to consider that the same rules and configurations apply
as with `PATCH` and `POST` requests. This means that the `isEditable` attribute determines whether existing
items can be modified during a `PUT` request. Additionally, the `isCreatable` attribute is used for non-existing
items that are created automatically according to the `PUT` request RFC.

In technical terms, the `PUT` request follows the same guidelines as `PATCH` and `POST` requests in relation to
the definition and database-specific configurations. The `isEditable` attribute governs the update capability
of existing items during a `PUT` request, ensuring that only editable fields can be modified. Similarly, the `isCreatable`
attribute pertains to non-existing items and governs their automatic creation as part of the `PUT` request process,
adhering to the standards outlined in the `PUT` request RFC. It's crucial to adhere to these rules and configurations
to ensure accurate and consistent data manipulation during `PUT` operations.
