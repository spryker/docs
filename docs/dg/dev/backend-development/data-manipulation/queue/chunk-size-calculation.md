## Chunk Size Calculation

In an e-commerce framework, selecting the correct queue chunk size for processing data is critical for ensuring optimal performance and efficient resource usage. The challenge arises from the diversity of business entities, stores, and locales, each with different memory and CPU requirements for denormalization. Furthermore, the frequency of updates, data sizes, and the specific configurations of various system services (e.g., Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ) make it difficult to determine the appropriate chunk size for each queue.

Without proper queue chunk size configuration, projects can either overconsume resources, leading to crashes or lag, or underutilize resources, resulting in slow performance. This is where the **Chunk Size Calculator** comes in—offering a solution that helps developers fine-tune queue chunk sizes based on the specific characteristics of the project.

### What is the Chunk Size Calculator?

The **Chunk Size Calculator** is a tool that helps developers determine the appropriate queue chunk sizes for processing data across different queues in a resource-efficient way. It ensures that memory and CPU usage are optimized and prevents the system from being overwhelmed during data processing tasks. This tool is designed to handle the variability in entity sizes, stores, locales, and update frequencies, giving developers confidence that project will run smoothly in production environments.

### The Three Levels of the Chunk Size Calculator

The **Chunk Size Calculator** is a powerful tool for optimizing Publish and Sync’s resource consumption. It consists of three levels—**Basic**, **Advanced**, and **Expert**—each designed to cater to varying use cases, from simple out-of-the-box configurations to highly customized, complex environments. Developers are encouraged to start with the **Basic Chunk Size Calculator** and progress to the **Advanced** or **Expert** calculators as the complexity of their projects increases.

- **Basic**: Ideal for standard configurations with minimal customization.
- **Advanced**: Suited for moderately customized projects requiring more precise control over performance and resource usage.
- **Expert**: Designed for highly customized entities that demand detailed configurations and fine-tuning.

#### 1. Basic Chunk Size Calculator

The **Basic Chunk Size Calculator** is a tool designed to help developers configure optimal queue chunk sizes for small to medium B2C projects with low customization with minimal configuration effort. It ensures efficient processing by aligning queue chunk sizes with traffic and data distribution. Ideal for out-of-the-box or minimally customized setups.

The **Basic Chunk Size Calculator** is available for use [here](link to Google spreadsheet); please make a copy of the spreadsheet to experiment with and adjust the settings as needed for your project.

##### Purpose and Use Case

In e-commerce environments, some business entities generate frequent updates due to high transaction volumes, commonly referred to as **high traffic entities**. These entities—such as products, prices, and offers—drive most of the traffic within the **publish and synchronize** operations. Misconfiguring queue chunk sizes can result in inefficient resource consumption, performance bottlenecks, or system overloads. The **Basic Chunk Size Calculator** streamlines this process by computing chunk sizes based on your project’s data profile, making it an ideal starting point for projects with standard configurations and predictable traffic patterns.

##### Key Input Parameters

To calculate the correct queue chunk sizes, the following data should be provided:

- **High Traffic Entities**: Input the total count of each high-traffic entity type (e.g., products, prices, offers) across all stores, along with an estimate of the daily refresh rate (either as a percentage or a daily update count).
- **Stores and Locales**: Specify the total number of stores and the maximum number of supported locales across these stores. This information impacts data distribution and chunk sizing.

- **Publish and Synchronize Setup**: Since entity data updates are managed through **publish and synchronize** operations, describe how workers are set up in relation to stores in the system.
  > For additional details on workers and tasks, refer to [this link](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/pbc/all/dynamic-multistore/202410.0/base-shop/dynamic-multistore-feature-overview.html).
- **Number of Tasks Per Worker**: Define the number of tasks each worker will handle, as this affects resource allocation and task distribution. This parameter should align with your project’s specific setup.

##### Important Considerations

- The **Basic Chunk Size Calculator** is optimized for systems with standard, out-of-the-box configurations. If your setup includes significant customization, consider using the **Advanced** or **Expert Chunk Size Calculator** for fine-tuned configuration.
- This calculator requires only a basic understanding of your system’s entity data and store structure. More complex metrics, like memory usage and container performance, might necessitate advanced calculators.
- Ensure the recommended queue chunk sizes are correctly configured to maintain optimal system performance.

#### 2. Advanced Chunk Size Calculator

The **Advanced Chunk Size Calculator** builds upon the **Basic Chunk Size Calculator**, requiring developers to have a deeper understanding of the services that make up the project.

The **Advanced Chunk Size Calculator** is available for use [here](link to Google spreadsheet); please make a copy of the spreadsheet to experiment with and adjust the settings as needed for your project.

##### Purpose and Use Case

The **Advanced Chunk Size Calculator** is ideal for moderately customized projects or when developers need greater control over performance and resource usage. It goes beyond the **Basic Chunk Size Calculator** by taking into account resource allocations, such as container sizes, CPU, and memory limits, allowing for a more tailored configuration that aligns with specific project needs. 

##### Key Input Parameters

To calculate the correct queue chunk sizes, the following data should be provided:

- **Scheduler and Worker Setup**: Provide details on non-standard configurations, such as multiple containers or distinct worker distributions within containers if your scheduler setup differs from the default.
- **Resource Configuration**: Specify the hardware setup, including instance types, CPU, and memory limits for services like **Persistence**, **Storage**, **Search**, or **Message Broker** to optimize chunk sizes based on actual resource availability.
