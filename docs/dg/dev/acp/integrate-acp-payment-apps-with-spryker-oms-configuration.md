This document describes how to set up your project with the ACP payment app, ensuring seamless integration with your customized Order Management System (OMS) configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following prerequisites are met:
- You have installed the Spryker Order Management System. For the installation instructions, see [Install the Order Management feature](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{site.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-features/install-the-order-management-feature.html).
- You are familiar with the basics of OMS provided in [Order Management feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{site.version}}/base-shop/order-management-feature-overview/order-management-feature-overview.html), [State machine cookbook](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{site.version}}/base-shop/state-machine-cookbook/state-machine-cookbook.html) and their sub-pages.

## Default ACP Payment App OMS  

The default ACP Payment App OMS configuration is located at `vendor/spryker/sales-payment/config/Zed/Oms/ForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml`.
This configuration is assigned to each order paid with an ACP Payment App payment method. Use this one as a starting point to build your own.

### XML file structure

The main OMS file includes `<subprocesses>` â€“ similar to libraries or building blocks with their own `<states>`, `<transitions>`, and `<events>`:

#### Subprocesses 

A typical state machine consists of a couple of sub processes which are representing your complete order process. 

Here is an example on how to add sub processes.

```xml
<subprocesses>
    <process name="PaymentAuthorization" file="Subprocess/PaymentAuthorization01.xml"/>
    <!-- Other subprocesses -->
</subprocesses>
```

Each process in the `<subprocesses>` section has a start state, one or more final states, and the states are linked to each other in the main State Machine .xml file.

Other sub processes provided by Spryker are:
- `ItemClose01`
- `ItemReturn01`
- `ItemSupply01`
- `ItemSupplyNonMarketplace01`
- `MerchantOrder01` - Only needed for Marketplaces
- `MerchantPayout01` - Only needed for Marketplaces
- `MerchantPayoutReverse01` - Only needed for Marketplaces
- `PaymentCancel01`
- `PaymentCapture01`
- `PaymentRefund01`
- `PaymentRefund01NonMarketplace`

You can use those as examples and or building blocks for your own state machine definition.


### Transition of orders and order items

Spryker provides two ways of dealing with transitions between states based on the Payment Apps behaviour and states. Both options require a slightly different set up that will be explained in the following sections.

- Triggering events bases on the Payment App messages.
- Using conditional transitions based on the Payment App messages and used condition plugins.

The first one is set up by adding the `\Spryker\Zed\Payment\Communication\Plugin\MessageBroker\PaymentOperationsMessageHandlerPlugin` to your MessageBrokerDependencyProvider.
The second one is set up by adding the `\Spryker\Zed\PaymentApp\Communication\Plugin\MessageBroker\PaymentAppOperationsMessageHandlerPlugin` to your MessageBrokerDependencyProvider and condition plugins.

#### Transition by using event triggers

The `\Spryker\Zed\Payment\Communication\Plugin\MessageBroker\PaymentOperationsMessageHandlerPlugin` has message handlers attached that will trigger events based on the received messages from the Payment App.

Transitions between states occur automatically via asynchronous ACP messages handled by the `spryker/message-broker` module.
The sub-processes with auto-transitions are: `PaymentAuthorization`, `PaymentCapture`, `PaymentRefund`, and `PaymentCancel`.

The MessageBroker worker checks for new messages in the background (cron job) and triggers OMS events based on
the configuration in `\Spryker\Zed\Payment\PaymentConfig::getSupportedOrderPaymentEventTransfersList()`. You can modify this configuration for your project.

{% info_block infobox %}

Use this approach when you follow closely the default `ForeignPaymentStateMachine01` and most importantly, when you know your OMS does not have any slow running commands which could lead to loss of transitions.

The status of a payment on the App side can change very fast and could lead to the issue that your OMS is not in a state where the transition can be made. 

F.e. when you have to have a command somewhere between `PaymentAuthorized` and `PaymentCapturePending` that takes longer to process and a message is received that want to trigger the transition from `PaymentCapturePending` to `PaymentCaptured` the OMS will not be able to do this transition as the transitions is currently not possible.

{% endinfo_block %}

#### Conditional transitions

The `\Spryker\Zed\PaymentApp\Communication\Plugin\MessageBroker\PaymentAppOperationsMessageHandlerPlugin` works differently then the above. When a message is received from the Payment App, the message handler will persist a status of the payment that is given on the App side. Through conditions (list down below) the OMS will check if the payment is in a state that allows the transition to the next state.

##### Conditions
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusAuthorizationFailedConditionPlugin` 
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusAuthorizedConditionPlugin` 
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCanceledConditionPlugin` 
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCancellationFailedConditionPlugin` 
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCapturedConditionPlugin` 
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCaptureFailedConditionPlugin` 
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCaptureRequestedConditionPlugin` 
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusOverpaidConditionPlugin` 
- `IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusUnderpaidConditionPlugin` 

Each of the conditions checks if a payment is in an expected state and if so transitions to the next one. This completely decouples your OMS from the Payment App and allows you to have slow running commands in your OMS and a much more fine-grained control.

To be able to use this approach you also need to add the OOTB provided condition plugins to your OMS configuration in the `OmsDependencyProvider::extendConditionPlugins`.

If you see some transitions are not happening as expected you can change the configuration via the `\Spryker\Zed\PaymentApp\PaymentAppConfig::STATUS_MAP` constant.

This configuration enables the Payment App states to move faster than your OMS but your OMS conditions can still execute. F.e. the Payment App status is already moved to `PaymentCaptured` but your OMS is still in `new` state, when you now ask via conditions if the payment is authorized it will return `true` as before a payment is set to `PaymentCaptured` as it was already authorized.


### Automatic transitions of states

The list of payment event messages is predefined, and they are common for all payment methods from the ACP App Catalog:
- `PaymentAuthorized`
- `PaymentAuthorizationFailed`
- `PaymentCanceled`
- `PaymentCancellationFailed`
- `PaymentCaptured`
- `PaymentCaptureFailed`
- `PaymentRefunded`
- `PaymentRefundFailed`
- `PaymentOverpaid`
- `PaymentUnderpaid`

Make sure that these messages are configured in your `config_default.php`.

{% info_block infoBox "Manual transition between states" %}

In case where a payment operation happened offline or was changed in the payment provider system, but the corresponding message about it wasn't sent or was lost, you can manually trigger a transition for each operation in the Back Office. For instructions on how to change states of orders, see [Change the state of order items](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{site.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/orders/change-the-state-of-order-items.html).

For example, if an order got stuck in the `"payment capture pending"` state, a Back office user can make sure that the payment is resolved through alternative means and click **payment capture successful** to transition the order to the `"payment captured"` state.

{% endinfo_block %}

### Payment operation commands

The following commands have to be triggered from your OMS to tell the Payment App where you are and what to do next. 

The default OMS setup has three commands:
- `Payment/Capture`
- `Payment/Cancel`
- `Payment/Refund`

The commands send asynchronous ACP messages to a payment app, allowing it to schedule the requested operation for a specific amount for the selected order and its items. The payment app responds with a payment event message indicating either success or failure.

The list of payment command messages is predefined:
- `CapturePayment`
- `CancelPayment`
- `RefundPayment`

In the project OMS configuration, you can put these commands into the needed transition.

## Configuring OMS for your project

As each project has its unique order flow and use cases, customize your OMS configuration while ensuring compatibility with ACP Catalog payment methods. Follow these steps:

1. Create your own payment OMS configuration based on `ForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml`. Copy this file along with the `Subprocess/` folder to the project root `config/Zed/oms`.
2. Rename the file, for example to `MyProjectForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml` and update the `<process name="MyProjectForeignPaymentStateMachine01">` tag at the beginning of the file.
3. Enable your new OMS configuration in the application config file:

```php
// config_default.php

$config[OmsConstants::PROCESS_LOCATION] = [
    OmsConfig::DEFAULT_PROCESS_LOCATION, # check that you have this line
];
$config[OmsConstants::ACTIVE_PROCESSES] = [
    //...
    'MyProjectForeignPaymentStateMachine01',
];
$config[SalesConstants::PAYMENT_METHOD_STATEMACHINE_MAPPING] = [
    //...
    PaymentConfig::PAYMENT_FOREIGN_PROVIDER => 'MyProjectForeignPaymentStateMachine01',
];
```

### Adding Commands and Conditions

#### Adding Commands

You can add new commands to the OMS configuration by extending the `OmsDependencyProvider::extendCommandPlugins` method. 

```php
...
protected function extendCommandPlugins(Container $container): Container
{
    $container->extend(self::COMMAND_PLUGINS, function (CommandCollectionInterface $commandCollection) {
        ...
        // ----- External PSP
        $commandCollection->add(new SendCapturePaymentMessageCommandPlugin(), 'Payment/Capture');
        $commandCollection->add(new SendRefundPaymentMessageCommandPlugin(), 'Payment/Refund');
        $commandCollection->add(new RefundCommandPlugin(), 'Payment/Refund/Confirm');
        $commandCollection->add(new SendCancelPaymentMessageCommandPlugin(), 'Payment/Cancel');
        $commandCollection->add(new MerchantPayoutCommandByOrderPlugin(), 'SalesPaymentMerchant/Payout');
        $commandCollection->add(new MerchantPayoutReverseCommandByOrderPlugin(), 'SalesPaymentMerchant/ReversePayout');

        return $commandCollection;
    });

    return $container;
}

```

Update the list of commands to your needs.

#### Adding Conditions

You can add new conditions to the OMS configuration by extending the `OmsDependencyProvider::extendConditionPlugins` method. 

```php
protected function extendConditionPlugins(Container $container): Container // phpcs:ignore SlevomatCodingStandard.Functions.UnusedParameter
{
    $container->extend(self::CONDITION_PLUGINS, function (ConditionCollectionInterface $conditionCollection) {
        // ----- External PSP
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsMerchantPaidOutConditionPlugin(), 'SalesPaymentMerchant/IsMerchantPaidOut');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsMerchantPayoutReversedConditionPlugin(), 'SalesPaymentMerchant/IsMerchantPayoutReversed');

        // ----- External PSP V2 Condition to ask for payment state instead of getting it told by the PSP
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusAuthorizationFailedConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsAuthorizationFailed');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusAuthorizedConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsAuthorized');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCanceledConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsCanceled');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCancellationFailedConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsCancellationFailed');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCapturedConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsCaptured');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCaptureFailedConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsCaptureFailed');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusCaptureRequestedConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsCaptureRequested');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusOverpaidConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsOverpaid');
        $conditionCollection->add(new IsPaymentAppPaymentStatusUnderpaidConditionPlugin(), 'Payment/IsUnderpaid');

        return $conditionCollection;
    });

    return $container;
}
```

Update the list of conditions to your needs.


## Customizing for your business flow

You have several options to customize your business flow: 

- Without shipping
- Without return and refund
- Without payment authorization and cancellation

### OMS without shipping
If your project doesn't involve product shipping, customize the main .XML file and each subprocess in the .XML file.
For example, you can change the transition from `"invoiced"` to `"payment capture ready"` state, making a direct transition
from `"invoiced"` to `"payment capture pending"` with `event = start payment capture`, which has the command `"Payment/Capture"` on-enter:

```xml
<transition happy="true">
    <source>invoiced</source>
    <target>payment capture pending</target>
    <event>start payment capture</event>
</transition>
```

![oms-without-shipping](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/dg/dev/acp/integrate-acp-payment-apps-with-spryker-oms-configuration/oms-without-shipping.png)


### OMS without return and refund

If your project doesn't require returns and refunds, remove the `"ItemReturn"` and `"PaymentRefund"` processes from the main .XML file under `<subprocesses>` and at the bottom of the file:

```xml
<!-- Remove these lines -->
<process name="ItemReturn" file="Subprocess/ItemReturn01.xml"/>
<process name="PaymentRefund" file="Subprocess/PaymentRefund01.xml"/>
```

Also, remove the transition in the main file using states from the removed processes:

```xml
<!-- Remove this transition -->
<transition>
    <source>returned</source>
    <target>payment refund ready</target>
    <event>refund</event>
</transition>
```

Now, your OMS won't include blocks for `"ItemReturn"` and `"PaymentRefund"`.

### OMS without payment authorization and cancellation

For a simpler payment flow without pre-authorization, cancellation, and refunds, your configuration will be much simpler without these blocks:

- PaymentAuthorization
- PaymentCancel
- ItemReturn
- PaymentRefund

### The most critical elements that must stay in your project

The following elements are critical and must stay in your project. They are responsible for the messages sent to the ACP payment apps to run payment operations for the specific order or order items:

1. `\Pyz\Zed\MessageBroker\MessageBrokerDependencyProvider::PLUGINS_MESSAGE_HANDLER` has plugins:
- `Spryker\Zed\Payment\Communication\Plugin\MessageBroker\PaymentOperationsMessageHandlerPlugin` 
- `Spryker\Zed\Payment\Communication\Plugin\MessageBroker\PaymentMethodMessageHandlerPlugin`

2. `\Spryker\Zed\Oms\OmsDependencyProvider::COMMAND_PLUGINS` has commands: 
- `$commandCollection->add(new SendCapturePaymentMessageCommandPlugin(), 'Payment/Capture');`
- `$commandCollection->add(new SendRefundPaymentMessageCommandPlugin(), 'Payment/Refund');`
- `$commandCollection->add(new SendCancelPaymentMessageCommandPlugin(), 'Payment/Cancel');`
