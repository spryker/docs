## Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.*

From version 2 we added support for multi-currency. First of all, make sure that you [migrated the Price module](/docs/scos/dev/module-migration-guides/{{page.version}}/migration-guide-price.html). We have changed collector dependency to use `PriceProduct` module instead of price, please update your code accordingly if you overwrote the core.
