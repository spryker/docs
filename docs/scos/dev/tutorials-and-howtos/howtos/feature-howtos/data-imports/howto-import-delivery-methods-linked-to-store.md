In addition to [adding](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{site.version}}/administration/delivery-methods/add-delivery-methods.html) and [editing delivery methods](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{site.version}}/administration/delivery-methods/edit-delivery-methods.html) in the Back Office, you can also import them with the stores assigned from a CSV file.

By default, the data is stored to the `/ShipmentDataImport/data/import/delivery_method_store.csv` file that contains the following columns:

```yaml
shipment_method_key,store_name
```

where:
* `shipment_method` is a delivery method's name you want to create.
* `store_name` is a store in which the delivery method are available.

To import delivery methods linked to the stores from the `/ShipmentDataImport/data/import/delivery_method_store.csv` file, run the following command:

```bash
console data:import:shipment-method-store
```

If successful, the imported data is added to the `spy_shipment_method_store` database table and appears on the list of delivery methods in the Back Office. For more information about viewing and updating the delivery methods, see [adding](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{site.version}}/administration/delivery-methods/add-delivery-methods.html) and [editing delivery methods](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{site.version}}/administration/delivery-methods/edit-delivery-methods.html).
