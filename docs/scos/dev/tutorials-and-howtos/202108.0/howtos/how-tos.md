HowTos are simple step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process of performing a single task. There are three types of HowTos: [Feature HowTos](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/about-feature-howtos), [Glue API HowTos](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/about-glue-api-howtos) and miscellaneous _HowTos for developers_.
