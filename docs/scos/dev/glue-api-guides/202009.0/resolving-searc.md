This endpoints allows resolving Search Engine Friendly (SEF) URLs into a resource URL in Glue API.

For SEO purposes, Spryker automatically generates SEF URLs for products and categories. The URLs are returned as a `url` attribute in responses related to abstract products and product categories. For examples of such responses, see: 
* [Retrieve an abstract product](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/retrieving-abstract-products#retrieve-an-abstract-product)
* [Retrieve a category tree](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/retrieving-category-trees#retrieve-a-category-tree)
* [Retrieve a category node](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/retrieving-category-nodes#retrieve-a-category-node)


## Installation
