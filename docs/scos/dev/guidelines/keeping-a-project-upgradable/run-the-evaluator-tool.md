## Install the evaluator tool

* Install the evaluator tool in your project by using the composer:

```

* Get general information about the tool and see all the commands related to evaluation in the `evaluate` section:

```

## Run an evaluation

To evaluate your code, run the evaluator in one of the following ways:

* Evaluate the code of all the modules:

```bash
vendor/bin/evaluator evaluate
```

* Evaluate the code of a specific module:

```bash
vendor/bin/evaluator evaluate --path=src/path_to_module
```
