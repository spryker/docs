The Spryker Commerce OS is fully compliant with international GDPR regulations. For example, customers can delete their account information, subscribe or unsubscribe from newsletters. Shop owners can also delete a customer account through the Back Office. However, this action does not affect billing and order related information. Deleting an account anonymizes customer information and address data.
