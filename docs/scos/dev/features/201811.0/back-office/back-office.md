The Spryker Commerce OS includes a powerful and user-friendly Back Office that allows you to manage all back-office tasks with ease. Made to synchronize your OS with your ERP and other external systems, you can easily retrieve all your content pages, product and customer data and settings and preferences.

The Back Office also enables you to:

* Customize and define store appearance.
* Control who can access the Administration Interface and what tasks they can perform by defining custom user permissions and creating different user groups.

Read more if you are responsible for back-end processes maintenance such as authorization management, protecting your data and integrating securely with 3rd party systems.

The main benefits of working with the Back Office are that you can save time, reduce costs while ensuring security and compliance in your organization.
