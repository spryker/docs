Let shoppers browse your catalog quickly with the highly flexible filter and search features. The out-of-the-box Elasticsearch technology allows you to include full-text search, autosuggest and autocomplete. Further search features let you set individual search preferences for multiple stores, for example. Categorizing your products and adding dynamic filters and facets helps your customers to refine the search results further. In addition to the custom filters, you can also add more advanced filters that make use of the products' metadata, for example. Further features enable you to promote a brand's top-sellers or highly rated products.
