## Category Blocks
Category blocks are blocks that can be embedded into the category template, for which we can specify on which specific categories we want them to be rendered.
		
For example, we have a Christmas sale that affects the categories  related to toys and sweets. We want to apply the following discount rule for these categories: "When you buy 3 products from this category, the product with a lower price is  free". 

We would like to promote this sale by placing a block that displays the discount rule on the affected categories only.

## Product Blocks
Product blocks are blocks that can be embedded in the product template, for which we can specify on which specific product we want them to be rendered.
