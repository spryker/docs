To enhance the visual shopping experience for your customers, you can easily group together different products by any attribute you wish, like color or size. The respective product group will then be displayed as a single item in the shop. In the backend, you can view all product group items from the product page.

Product groups are used to link abstract products together which are equal from the customer point of view (e.g. different colors of a shoe).

* Place product groups in cms placeholders

The Product Groups feature allows to group together multiple abstract products for various reasons. One of the most common use cases of this feature is to group same products with different colors together to make userâ€™s browsing more convenient.

Once products are grouped together, on catalog and product detail pages instead of displaying individual item you can display the group. This means which each product you can also display references to other products which are in the same group as you produce.

## Current Constraints
 
{% info_block infoBox %}
Currently, the feature has the following functional constraints which are going to be resolved in the future.
{% endinfo_block %}

* product groups can be added only by means of importing them or modifying database
* there is no user interface for that
