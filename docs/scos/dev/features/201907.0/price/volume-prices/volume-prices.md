In B2B business model every shop owner aims to explore new markets, experience significant growth, have more orders on the website and, thus, increase the sales. For some store owners that means working hard and spending more money. A better option is to get your customers to checkout with more products in their cart.

The Volume Prices is a simple, yet effective feature for Store Administrators to set specific prices for units based on quantities and incentivize individuals or businesses to purchase goods in multiple units or in large quantities. For example, one bottle of coca-cola may cost $2. However, if the customer buys 20 bottles they will get a special price of $1,50 per bottle.
