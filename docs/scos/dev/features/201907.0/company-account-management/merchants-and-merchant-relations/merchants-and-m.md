In the context of Spryker B2B eCommerce platform, there can be three key figures: marketplace owner, merchant and buyer.

* The marketplace owner owns the platform and acts as a broker between merchants and buyers.
* The merchants are actually sellers usually represented by a company.
* The buyers are often business units of companies that purchase products or services from the merchants.

The business relationships between merchants and buyers are usually based on contracts.

The diagram below shows relations within the merchant domain:
