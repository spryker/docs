A shopping cart is considered to be one of the most important components of any online shop. To make it fast and easy for your customers to create and access shopping carts as well as the shopping cart tool should be well noticeable and easily accessible. In Spryker shop, we have accomplished this by placing the shopping list widget right in the header. With the Shopping Cart Widget, customers can easily create new shopping carts as well as view details about the existing ones by just putting a cursor on a shopping cart icon in the header. This feature will add convenience to your customers, save their time, simplify the ordering process, as well create an overall positive buying experience for your customers, inducing them to fast and multiple purchases from your shop.
