With Cart Rules and Discounts you can create special rules and apply them to cart content, such as cart value thresholds or specific items in the cart.

Give your customers special cart-based discounts to boost sales. The Cart Rule query builder allows you to create special rules and apply them to cart content, such as cart value thresholds or specific items in the cart.

A cart rule is a discount that is automatically added to the quote if certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions can be entered as a query string. For instance you can say that the cart rule is applied if the subtotal is higher than an amount and the day-of-the week is Tuesday. Alternatively you can also define a SKU and a quantity to promote specific products directly.
