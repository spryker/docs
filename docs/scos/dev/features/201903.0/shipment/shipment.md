Allow your customers to choose from multiple shipping carriers and methods that you can easily integrate. Offer free shipping or discounts based on the carrier, the shipping method or the order price to improve the average order volume. To support multiple stores, the Spryker Commerce OS allows you to display the delivery costs in multiple currencies and offer several shipment methods. Easily specify how the delivery costs of each shipping method are calculated.
