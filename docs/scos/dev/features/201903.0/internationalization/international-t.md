Align your business with international tax standards by defining tax rates and sets. Determine country-based tax rates for products, options and shipments, that will automatically be applied to the respective shops.

In a tax system, the tax rate is the ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) at which a business or person is taxed. While tax set is a set of tax rates that can be applied to a specific product.

Both tax sets and tax rates are defined in the **Back Office > Taxes** section.

You can group and name a set of tax rates that apply to certain product groups and countries, and easily import predefined tax rates and sets.
