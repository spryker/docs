To help your customers locate items in your shop more easily you can add customizable Category Filters to the catalog pages or simply fall back to the standard Category Filters. You can add, rearrange and define filters for any given parameter in the category tree, such as price or brand.

See [Managing category filters](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-category-filters) for details on how you can manage Category filters in the Back Office.

## Current Constraints

Currently, the feature has the following functional constraints which are going to be resolved in the future:

* Category filters are shared across all the stores of a project.
* It is impossible to restrict availability of a category filter to a store.
