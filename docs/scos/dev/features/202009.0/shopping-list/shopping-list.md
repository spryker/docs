Enable your Business customers to save the products they wish to purchase through the Shopping List Feature. Different roles and permissions systems ensure a smooth sharing and contribution management amongst a companyâ€™s users.

Printing a Shopping List, with or without a barcode and the ability to add items right from shopping lists to cart makes the reordering process easy for your customers. Effectively, reduce cart abandonment, boost your sales and keep track of which products your customers are interested in. Allow your customers to create multiple Shopping Lists and customize the existing ones.
