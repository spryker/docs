The Spryker Commerce OS lets you to define multiple currencies per store for product, product option and shipping method. A product can, for example, cost 5 EUR in Germany, 6 EUR in France and 5 CHF in Switzerland. Your customers may easily choose between these different currencies.

All prices on the **Product Page** and in the **Cart** are adjusted automatically upon changing the currency.

{% info_block infoBox %}
Products for which you did not define a price in a specific currency do not appear in the catalog for that currency.
{% endinfo_block %}
