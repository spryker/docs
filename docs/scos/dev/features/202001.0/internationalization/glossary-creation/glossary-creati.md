In the Glossary you can easily store basic text information in different languages so your customers can switch to their preferred one. In the shop, all stored text keys will be automatically adjusted, once language is switched.

{% info_block infoBox %}
By default, languages are identified by a locale:<br>**de_DE** means "German language in Germany"<br>**de_CH** means "German language in Switzerland"
