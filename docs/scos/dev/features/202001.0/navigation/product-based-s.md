The Product-Based Navigation can easily reflect any grouping of products you wish. Customize your store's Navigation in the Back Office and add, edit or delete elements. Build relationships to pages outside the store, to support SEO capabilities through backlinks for improved ranking, or special promotions. Easily set validity dates for your navigational elements for promotional or seasonal purposes.
