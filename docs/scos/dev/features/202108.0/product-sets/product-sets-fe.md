The *Product Sets* feature allows you to create and sell collections of products. For example, you can create a stationary workspace set, a set of clothing or accessories, or furniture for a specific room.

When browsing a product set, a Storefront user can select variants per product in a set, add an individual or all products from the set to cart.

A Back Office user can define the following:
* The order of products in a set dispalyed on the Storefront.
* The order of products sets displayed on the Storefront. It's relevant if you have multiple product sets on the same page. 
* Unique product set URL.

 
A Back Office user can add a product sets to any page by [creating a product set content item](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-content-items) and [adding it to CMS pages and blocks](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/adding-content-items-to-cms-pages-and-blocks).

* Product sets are shared across all the stores of a project.
* You cannot restrict availability of a product set to a store.
