Most often shop visitors search for products, however, they also might need other information, like terms and conditions, legal information, or contacts, which is contained on [CMS pages](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/cms-page).

The CMS pages in search results functionality allows searching not only for products but for the content of CMS pages too. At the same time, the search results related to products and CMS pages do not intervene with each other. The search results page is split into two tabs: for product pages and CMS pages. The latter tab displays CMS pages as a grid or as a list.

Page sorting and pagination on the search results page helps shop visitors to find content easier. Breadcrumbs allow a shop administrator to structure the content to reduce the number of steps a customer takes to return to a previous page.
