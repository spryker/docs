Enable your Business customers to save the products they wish to purchase through the Shopping List feature. Different roles and permissions systems ensure a smooth sharing and contribution management amongst a companyâ€™s users.

In the B2B world, shopping lists are used as templates for frequently bought items. For example, a retail store might be keeping a list of items they buy periodically to replenish stock. Sometimes B2B customers need more than one shopping list. For example, one for products they buy every day, one for weekly shopping, and one more to use monthly.

With the Spryker Shopping Lists feature, you can manage multiple shopping lists and share them within an entire business unit or with individual users. Business units and its members can have different permissions to the shopping list: no access, read-only or full access.

In a Spryker shop, a shopping list widget is located in the header. With the shopping list widget, customers can easily create new shopping lists as well as view details about the existing ones.

Shopping list notes enable customers to attach notes to shopping list items. For example, they might add a note saying that prior to purchase it is necessary to make sure a product is not available in their stock, or check if even more of it should be bought. When a customer transfers shopping list items to cart, the notes are taken over, appearing as [cart notes](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/cart-notes) there.
