In the B2B partnership, which is usually based on contracts, the selling company is also referred to as a merchant and the buyer is often represented by a business unit of a buying company. In Spryker B2B shop system, the merchant relation entity is used to connect merchants and buyers together. 

There are three key figures: marketplace owner, merchant, and buyer.

* The marketplace owner owns the platform and acts as a broker between merchants and buyers.
* The merchants are sellers usually represented by a [company](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/company-account-overview#company).
* The buyers are often [business units](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/business-unit-overview) of companies that purchase products or services from the merchants.

The business relationships between merchants and buyers are usually based on contracts.
