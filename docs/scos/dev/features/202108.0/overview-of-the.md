The feature guides describe features in details, highlight their functional abilities, business values, and use-case examples. This information might be useful for: 
* Business owners
* Product owners
* Anyone looking to learn more about the Spryker features or add new functionality to a Spryker-based project

The *Features* section is divided into capabilities. Each capability contains a capability description and conceptual documentation of all the features a capability includes.

In the feature documentation, you will find the following information:

* A short feature summary with guidelines designed for different [personas](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/about-documentation#personas){target="_blank"}.
* A detailed feature overview, workflows, database structure, and more.

The documentation in the *Features* section provides reference information that should not be used as guidelines. If you want to learn how to use or install a feature, you can find all the guides related to a feature on its summary page, like [Content items](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/content-items-201907).

Or, you can go directly to the following guides:

* [Back Office user guide](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/about-the-administration-interface-guide){target="_blank"}: for step-by-step guides on how to work with the features in the Back Office.
* [Feature integration guides](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/about-integration){target="_blank"}: for developer guides on how to integrate a feature into a Spryker project.
