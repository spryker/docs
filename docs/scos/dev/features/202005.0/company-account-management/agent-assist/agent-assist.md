Add a human touch to your online shop with the Agent Assist feature. Entitle your customer support representatives with an Agent role to support your customers during the purchasing process. 
An Agent is a person with profound knowledge of the companyâ€™s product range and the shop system. The Agent can perform various activities on the shop on behalf of your customer. For example, the Agents can complete an order, create and share shopping lists, or even register a company as if they were that customer. This makes the Agents an asset for customers looking for personalized experiences as well as for those who need help to perform certain actions in an online store.

With the Spryker Agent Assist feature, you will be able to:
* Enhance customer satisfaction
* Ensure customer retention
* Increase conversion rates
* Diversify your customer base with those who were uncomfortable using the online shops and needed assistance
