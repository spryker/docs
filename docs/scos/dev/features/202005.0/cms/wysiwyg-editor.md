## What is WYSIWYG?
This is an editor that allows you to see what the end result will look like while the CMS element is being created.

WYSIWYG is an acronym for **what you see is what you get**.

It is a very user-friendly tool that allows you to modify text, as well as insert videos, images, or links.

You can select one of the following for the [content widget](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/cms-widget-overview-201903):

* chart
* product
* product_set
* product_group
* cms_file
* cms_block

Cms content widgets tips below the editor will help you to understand how the templates are used.

Except for the standard set of content editing capabilities, you can also switch to code view of your editor.
