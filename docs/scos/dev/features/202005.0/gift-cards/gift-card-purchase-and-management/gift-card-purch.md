The **Gift Card** feature allows you to create a virtual product with a chosen value amount. The purchase of a gift card generates an individual code that can then be used as a payment method during checkout. Gift Cards help you increase website traffic, gain new customers and boost brand awareness. 

A **Gift Card** is a prepaid certificate entitling its owner to purchase products for the gift cardâ€™s value. 

With the **Gift Cards** feature, your customers have the full freedom of choice to buy from the shop pretty much anything they like and when they want. This, among other things, makes the gift cards an ideal solution for last-minute holiday shoppers. 

**When buying a gift card**, an individual code is generated based on a pattern and can later be used as a payment method during the checkout. Shipping prices can be dropped out, as gift cards are sent via email.

**When paying for orders with a gift card**, the gift cards are considered as an additional payment method. You can use the full balance  or part of the total gift card's value. In the latter case, the remaining value will be stored as leftover balance on the original code. You can also use additional gift cards to pay for products. However, gift cards can only be applied for products in the same currency they have been bought.

The Gift Cards feature can be a perfect solution to:

* Increase sales Increase website traffic
* Engage with new customers and get them familiar with your products
* Promote your products in the online store
* Boost brand awareness
