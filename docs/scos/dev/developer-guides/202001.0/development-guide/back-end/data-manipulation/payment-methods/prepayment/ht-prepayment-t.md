When you have completed the instructions on [front end](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/ht-prepayment-f), [back end](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/ht-prepayment-b) and [shared](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/ht-prepayment-s) implementation, you are able to test the payment method you just implemented.

 This is the last step for this tutorial.
