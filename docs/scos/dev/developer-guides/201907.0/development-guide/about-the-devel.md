The Development Guide is intended to get developers up-and-running with the Spryker back-end and front-end development for their project.  It covers technical details of the Spryker Commerce OS to improve your understanding of the system and contains step-by-step instructions that will help you customize Spryker for your needs. 

These guides are grouped into the following sections:
**Back-End** - contains information on how to build the Back-end side of your project.
**Front-End** -  contains information on the Spryker Front-end architecture and concepts.
**Guidelines** - general development guidelines and rules.
**Best practices** - these section provides some of the best practices that developers might find useful.

Keep in mind, that topics in the **Back-End** and **Front-End** guides can intersect with each other, so we recommend viewing this separation as conditional and consult both of the sections to accomplish your tasks.
