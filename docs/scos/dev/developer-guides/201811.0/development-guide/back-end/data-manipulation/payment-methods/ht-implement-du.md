By default, Spryker provides the [DummyPayment](https://github.com/spryker/dummy-payment) module, which has Credit Card and Invoice payments implemented. You can make use of these implemented payment methods, as well as use the module for reference when implementing additional payment methods in your project. 
To demonstrate the way a new payment method is implemeted we have created a set of articles on [how to implement the Direct Debit payment method](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/201811.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/ht-implement-dd). Based on the examples in these articles, you can implement other payment methods for your projects.
