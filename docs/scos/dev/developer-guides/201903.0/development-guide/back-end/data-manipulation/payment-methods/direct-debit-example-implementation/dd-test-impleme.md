After the Direct Debit payment method has been set up on the [front end](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/201903.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/dd-fe-implement), [back end](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/201903.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/dd-be-implement) and [shared implementation](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/201903.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/dd-shared-imple), test it by [submitting a new order](/docs/scos/dev/user-guides/201903.0/shop-user-guide/checkout/checkout-shop-g) from Yves. Then, you can manage the flow of the order [in the Back Office](/docs/scos/dev/user-guides/201903.0/back-office-user-guide/sales/orders/managing-orders).
