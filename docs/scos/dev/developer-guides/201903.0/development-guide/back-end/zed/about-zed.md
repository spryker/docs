Zed is one of the application layers of the Spryker Commerce OS, providing the backoffice/backend functionality. 

{% info_block infoBox %}
See [Conceptual Overview](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/201903.0/architecture-guide/concept-overvie
{% endinfo_block %} to learn more about the Spryker applications and their layers.)

Zed is divided into three parts:

* Business layer, containing the entire business logic;
* Persistence layer, responsible for the database structure, connections to it, i.e., for the data persistence;
* Communication layer, enabling the connection to the external providers.

<!--The guides in this section provide a deep insight into each of the layers and their components.-->
