After the Direct Debit payment method has been set up on the [front end](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/dd-fe-implementation), [back end](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/dd-be-implementation) and [shared implementation](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/dd-shared-implementation), test it by [submitting a new order](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/checkout-shop-guide-201911) from Yves. Then, you can manage the flow of the order [in the Back Office](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/managing-orders).
