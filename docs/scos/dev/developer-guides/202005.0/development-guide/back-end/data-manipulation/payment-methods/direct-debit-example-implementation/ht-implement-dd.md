This set of articles will guide you through implementation of the Direct Debit payment method without integrating with a third party payment service provider.

The implementation process includes the following steps:

* [Implementation of Direct Debit in Yves](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/dd-fe-implementation)
* [Integration of Direct Debit into the checkout](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/dd-checkout-implementation)
* [Implementation of Direct Debit in Zed](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/dd-be-implementation)
* [Implementation of Direct Debit in the Shared layer](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/dd-shared-implementation)
* [Testing your Direct Debit Implementation](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/dd-test-implementation)

The order of the implementation steps does not really matter, however make sure you execute them all.
