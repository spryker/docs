{% info_block warningBox "BETA version" %}

The Data Export is currently a BETA feature.

{% endinfo_block %}
Export data on orders, generated in Spryker, to external systems like ERP or OMS using the Spryker Data Export feature. The current functionality allows you to export orders, order items, and order expenses data for one or multiple stores. At the same time, you donâ€™t need to export all the data - you can define a filter to run export for specific stores and time period of orders in a .yml export configuration file.
