Here you can find the latest Product release notes and the archived content. 

Due to the nature of the Spryker Commerce OS, we have Product Releases every several months. Every Product Release has its own version. The release notes contain the respective release version in their names. 
The Product Release code is stored in the [B2B Demo Shop repository](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop) and [B2C Demo Shop repository](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop).

For more information about our release process, see: [Spryker Release Process](/docs/scos/dev/about-spryker/202001.0/spryker-release).
