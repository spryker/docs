Starting from September 2019, PHP 7.1 will no longer be supported. Therefore, we strongly recommend switching to PHP 7.2+ until then.
In the future, we plan to add PHP 7.4 support as soon as it gets released (presumably, in December 2020) and deprecate 7.2 version around summer 2020. 
Visualized as a calendar, our previous/future PHP versions support is as follows:

For more details on the supported versions, check the official [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).
