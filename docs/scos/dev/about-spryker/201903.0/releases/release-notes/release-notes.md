Here you can find the latest release notes and archived content. 

Due to the nature of Spryker Commerce OS, we have releases nearly every day. Once or twice a month we aggregate this information into release notes and publish release information to out academy and our mailing list. 

For more information about our release process see: [Atomic Releases](https://spryker.com/blog/sprykers-atomic-releases).

Spryker has always prided itself in the fast pace of innovation and rapid development of new functionality. New features and enhancements are shipped almost daily.

Many customers benefit from these continuous releases and having  immediate access to new, sometimes even beta versions of Spryker's modules. At the same time, as our product grows, we also hear from you about the need to have a more structured and organized release approach. To accommodate both - fast pace of innovation and predictability of upgrade process, we would like to announce upcoming changes in Spryker's release process.

Going forward you will see two types of releases from Spryker: Code Releases &amp; Product Releases.

## Code Releases
Code Releases is a new name for our existing continuous release process. New versions of existing Spryker modules as well as new modules will be released, as soon as they are ready, in our code repositories.

The main benefit of Code Releases is that customers who urgently need this new functionality can get access to it asap. Such speed comes, of course, with some drawbacks.

We will make sure to provide a draft documentation for new functionality, as well as a module level upgrade guide, but will not be able to deliver full documentation and training materials at that time. Our QA team will validate the newly released functionality and overall quality of the module, but will not be able to thoroughly check new module compatibility with other modules in all required combinations.

Also, Code Releases won't be incorporated into the Demo Shops. We will continue to release some modules in beta versions as Code Releases.

## Product Releases
Product Releases will be done less frequently, approximately every three months. The Product Release will have its own version and will come together with corresponding Demo Shops.

A Product Release will be released with complete documentation, will not include beta modules, and all appropriate functionality will be incorporated and tested in the Demo Shop.

Spryker will provide a documented and tested upgrade from one Product Release to another.
