Starting from September 2019, **PHP 7.1** is no longer supported. 

Starting from October 2020, **PHP 7.2** will no longer be supported. Therefore, we strongly recommend switching to PHP 7.3+ until then.

It is already recommended to use **PHP 7.3+** as of right now as there are significant performance issues with PHP 7.2.

**PHP 7.4** support has been enabled fully as per May 2020 and further brings performance improvements.

We plan on adding **PHP 8** support in the beginning of 2021.

Visualized as a calendar, our previous/future PHP versions support is as follows:
