## Description

The issue occurs when setting up Docker and WSL 2 and adding routes to `etc/hosts` in one line on Windows. Host file has row 127.0.0.1.

## Cause

The cause of the issue might be in the maximum length limitaion of a line that you can have in your hosts file in Windows.

## Solution

In the hosts file, start a new line with `127.0.0.1`, and then add routes for services for which the hosts are not resolved.
