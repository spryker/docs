HowTos are simple step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process of performing a single task. There are three types of HowTos: [Feature HowTos](/docs/scos/dev/tutorials/202001.0/howtos/feature-howtos/about-feature-h), [Glue API HowTos](/docs/scos/dev/tutorials/202001.0/howtos/glue-api-howtos/about-glue-api-) and miscellaneous _HowTos for developers_.

**Feature HowTos** can be useful for shop owners, administrators and developers as they explain how to perform tasks related to Spryker features. Specifically, this section contains the following guides:
