## Resources for migration
* Backend
* Optional: DevOps


Spryker Cloud has a kinda standard for having file storage on an AWS S3 bucket. Therefore itâ€™s recommended to rework
all existing solutions which require certain file storage to use an S3 bucket.

We already have some ready solutions:
* [Data import using an S3 bucket as storage for CSV import files](/docs/cloud/dev/spryker-cloud-commerce-os/configuring-data-import-from-an-s3-bucket.html#prerequisites).
* [Data export to S3 bucket into JSON files](/docs/scos/dev/technology-partner-guides/202204.0/marketing-and-conversion/analytics/installing-and-integrating-minubo.html).
* [Flysystem module which works with S3 storage](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/data-manipulation/data-ingestion/structural-preparations/flysystem.html#plugin-example).
