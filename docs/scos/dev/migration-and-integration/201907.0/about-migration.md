This section of the documentation is dedicated to content describing all the migration and integration tasks you can possibly have.

[Module migration guides](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201907.0/module-migration-guides/about-migration) explain how to update a module that has structural changes, such as to the database.

[Migration Concepts](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201907.0/migration-concepts/about-migration) clarify the steps needed to be taken to migrate in case of extensive module migrations or deprecating some technical solution.

[Feature integration guides](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201907.0/feature-integration-guides/about-integrati) will guide you through the steps of enabling individual features in your project.

The [Updating the Legacy Demoshop with SCOS](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201907.0/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos/about-updating) guides will help you enhance the Legacy Demoshop with specific components of SCOS or make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with them.
