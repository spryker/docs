The Router is responsible for matching a request to a route and generating URLs based on a route name. The Spryker's Router module is based on the Symfony's Routing component; for more information on it, check out the [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html). This section describes how to install and configure the Router for [Yves](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201907.0/migration-concepts/silex-replacement/router/router-yves-201) and [Zed](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201907.0/migration-concepts/silex-replacement/router/router-zed-2019).
