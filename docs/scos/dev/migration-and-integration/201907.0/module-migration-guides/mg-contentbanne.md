## Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.*

Version 2.0.0 of the ContentBannerGui module introduces the [Content Items](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/content-items-overview-201907) functionality that allows creating and managing content and later selecting where it should be inserted.

With the ContentBannerGui version 2.0, we have made the following changes:

* Changed twig expression template.
* Changed the parameter ID to KEY.
* Changed the issue with saving relative URL for click and image URLs.

You can find more details about the changes on the [ContentBannerGui module release notes](https://github.com/spryker/content-banner-gui/releases/tag/2.0.0) page.

**To upgrade to the new version of the module, do the following:**
1. Upgrade the `Content` Module to version 2.0.0. Follow the steps described in [Migration Guide - Content](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201907.0/module-migration-guides/mg-content-2019).
