When a new major version of a module is released, it means that external API of the module has been changed. The migration guides describe how to update a module to the newer version. They provide manual instructions on how to do it step by step in our system. As you have most likely made structural changes of your own, we don't give you a script, but the steps for manual implementation for you to check if it suits your environment, and if it doesnâ€™t - you can use them as a basis to customize your environment.
If you have spotted an issue with either of the guides, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/spryker/documentation/issues) or pull request by using the Edit on GitHub option.
