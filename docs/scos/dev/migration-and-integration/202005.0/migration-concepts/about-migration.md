This section will help the developers to handle situations when a new feature requires an extensive migration effort for modules, or some technical solution used in Spryker needs to be replaced with a new one.

Here you will find instructions on how implement these changes in your project. The section includes the following parts:

* [Split Delivery Migration Concept](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/split-delivery-concept): Contains general information about the Split Delivery feature and describes the steps to update all the affected modules in bulk.
* [Silex Replacement Migration Concept](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/silex-replacement): Outlines the main changes to be applied in a project and concepts on how to migrate away from Silex to the Spryker Application replacing it.
