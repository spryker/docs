This section of the documentation is dedicated to content describing all the migration and integration tasks you can possibly have.

[Feature integration guides](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/about-integration) will guide you through the steps of enabling individual features in your project.

[Module migration guides](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/about-migration) explain how to update a module that has structural changes, such as to the database.

[Migration Concepts](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/about-migration-concepts) clarify the steps you need to take to migrate in case of extensive module migrations or deprecating some technical solution.

The [Updating the Legacy Demoshop with SCOS](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/about-updating) guides will help you enhance the Legacy Demoshop with specific components of SCOS or make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with them.
