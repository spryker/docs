If you use Spryker Legacy Demoshop, you can enhance it with specific components of SCOS. Previously Legacy Demoshop was an example and a boilerplate while starting a project. As you already forked project codebase and started development, migration to another demo shop (Master Suite, B2B/B2C Demo Shops) is NOT required.
		
With last releases we introduced 3 new concepts: Modular Frontend (Yves), Atomic Frontent (JS/CSS) and Publish&amp;Sync. You can extend your project with these concepts. For example, you can:

* [Make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with the Modular Frontend](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/demoshop-with-modular-frontend)
* [Make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with the Atomic Frontend](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/demoshop-with-atomic-frontend)
* [Set up ShopUiCompatibility module](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/setting-up-shopuicompatibility), which is the key module of the Atomic Frontend
* [Configure the Legacy Demoshop to use SCOS Twig templates](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/twig-compatibility-mode-demoshop-vs-suite), or 
* [Make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with Publish &amp; Syncrhonize](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/demoshop-with-publish-and-sync).
