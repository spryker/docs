The Router is responsible for matching a request to a route and generating URLs based on a route name. The Spryker's Router module is based on the Symfony's Routing component; for more information on it, check out the [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html). This section describes how to install and configure the Router for [Yves](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/router-yves-201907) and [Zed](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/router-zed-201907).
