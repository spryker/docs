This section of the documentation is dedicated to content describing all the migration and integration tasks you can possibly have.

[Module migration guides](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201811.0/module-migration-guides/about-migration) explain how to update a module that has structural changes, such as to the database.

[Feature integration guides](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201811.0/feature-integration-guides/about-integrati) will guide you through the steps of enabling individual features in your project.

The [Updating the Legacy Demoshop with SCOS](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/201811.0/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos/about-updating) guides will help you enhance the Legacy Demoshop with specific components of SCOS or make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with them.

If you have spotted an issue with either of the guides, please feel free to create an issue or pull request by using the **Edit or Report** option.
