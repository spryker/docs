4. Build your own workflow (create a new OMS which will use Hidelpay). See the section below for more information.

## Building a State Machine Workflow to Use Heidelpay Payment Methods

We use state machines for handling and managing orders and payments.
To use Heidelpay, [create a new OMS](http://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/oms-state-machine.htm) which includes necessary Heildelpay payment methods. You can use the same state machines or build new ones. The state machine commands and conditions trigger Heidelpay facade calls in order to perform the needed requests to Heidelpay API.

Some examples of the basic and fully functional state machines for each payment method were already built: `vendor/spryker-eco/heidelpay/config/Zed/Oms`

* `HeidelpaySofort01.xml`
* `HeidelpayPaypalDebit01.xml`
* `HeidelpayIdeal01.xml`
* `HeidelpaySofort01.xml`
* `HeidelpayCreditCardSecureAuthorize01.xml`
