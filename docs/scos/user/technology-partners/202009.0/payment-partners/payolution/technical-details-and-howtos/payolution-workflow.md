Both [invoice](/docs/scos/dev/technology-partners/202009.0/payment-partners/payolution/payolution-payment-methods/payolution-invoice-payment.html) and [installment](/docs/scos/dev/technology-partners/202009.0/payment-partners/payolution/payolution-payment-methods/payolution-installment-payment.html) payemnt methods utilize the same request flow. It basically consists of the following requests:

* Calculation (for installment only): to calculate the installment amounts, dues, and durations.
* Pre-check (optional): to check the user information in order to make sure that all the needed information is correct before doing the actual pre-authorization.
* Pre-authorize: to perform a payment risk check which is a mandatory step before every payment. The payment is basically considered accepted when it is authorized.
* Re-authorize: to update an existing authorization if necessary.
* Revert: to cancel the authorization step which basically cancels the payment before capturing.
* Capture: to capture the payment and receive money from the buyer.
* Refund: to refund the buyer when returning products.
