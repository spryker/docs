## Integrating RatePay Prepayment Payment

To integrate prepayment payment: set RatePAY prepayment payment configuration and call the facade functions.

### Set RatePay Prepayment Configuration

The configuration to integrate prepayment payments using RatePAY is:

* `PROFILE_ID`: merchant's login (required).
* `SECURITY_CODE`: merchant's password (required).
* `SHOP_ID`: shop identifier (required).
* `SYSTEM_ID`: system identifier (required).
* `CLIENT_VERSION`: client system version.
* `CLIENT_NAME`: client name.
* `RATEPAY_REQUEST_VERSION`: request version.
* `RATEPAY_REQUEST_XMLNS_URN`: request XMLNS urn.
* `MODE`: the mode of the transaction, either test or live (required).
* `API_TEST_URL`: test mode API URL.
* `API_LIVE_URL`: live mode API URL.

### Performing Requests

In order to perform the needed requests, you can easily use the implemented state machine commands and conditions. The RatePAY State Machine Commands and Conditions section gives a summary of them. You can also use the facade methods directly which, however, are invoked by the state machine.
