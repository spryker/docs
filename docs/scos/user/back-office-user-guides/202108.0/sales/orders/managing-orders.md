This article describes how to manage orders.

You manage orders by:
* Changing statuses of an order, or in item inside the order
* Commenting on orders (comments can be viewed by other Sales team members)
* Updating internal custom order reference

## Prerequisites

To start managing orders, go to **Sales** > **Orders**.

The instructions assume that there is an existing order with the *Payment pending* status.

Each section contains reference information. Make sure to review it before you start, or just look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Changing order statuses

To change the status of an order:

1. In the *List of orders* table, click **View** next to the order you want to change the status of.
You are taken to the *View Order: [Order ID]* page.
2. In the *Trigger all matching states inside this order* section, click **pay**. The page refreshes to show the message about the successful status change. In the *Trigger all matching states inside this order* section, you can see the **ship** button.
3. Repeat step 2 until you get the desired order status.

To change the status of the items in a shipment:

1. In *List of orders*, click **View** next to the order owning the items you want to change the status of.
You are taken to the *View Order: [Order ID]* page.
2. Scroll down to the desired shipment.
3. Select the checkbox next to the products you want to change the status of.
4. In the *Trigger all matching states of order inside this shipment* section, click **pay**.
  The page refreshes to show the message about the successful status change. In the *Trigger all matching states of order inside this shipment* section of the modified shipment, you can see the **ship** button.
5. Repeat step 4 until you get the desired shipment status.


To change the status of an item:

1. In *List of orders*, click **View** next to the order owning the items you want to change the status of.
You are taken to the *View Order: [order ID]* page.
2. Scroll down to the desired item.
3. In the _Trigger event_ column next to the desired product, click **pay**.
The page refreshes to show the message about the successful status change. In the _Trigger event_ column next to the product, you can see the **ship** button.


**Tips & tricks**
<br>To change the status of all the items inside a shipment at once, click **pay** in the *Trigger all matching states of order inside this shipment* section of the corresponding shipment.

The order statuses you set here do not always have the same wording on the Storefront. For details on how you can display custom names for statuses on the Storefront, see [HowTo - Display custom names for order item states on the Storefront](/docs/scos/dev/tutorials-and-howtos/howtos/feature-howtos/howto-display-custom-names-for-order-item-states-on-the-storefront.html).

### Reference information: Changing order statuses

You can set different statuses for your order. The followning describes the statuses you can select:

| ORDER STATUS | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| Pay | Select this state once you receive the payment for the order from your customer. |
| Cancel | Select this state to cancel the order on the customer’s behalf. |
| Skip Timeout | Select this status to end the time period during which the customer can cancel the order. |
| invoice-generate | Select this state to generate the invoice and send it to the customer. If invoice BCC is configured for your project, the copy of the invoice will be sent to the specified email address as well. You can trigger the invoice-generate only for the whole order. Even if you selected just some of the order items, the invoice is generated for the whole order.|
| Ship | Select this state once the order is shipped.|
| Stock-update | Select this state when you update the number of available products of products in **Products** > **Availability**. |
|  Close| Select this state when your customer has successfully received the ordered items and is satisfied with their quality.|
| Return | Select this state if the customer returns you either all or several items from the order.  |
| Refund | Select this state in case of a refund.|

Statuses flow:
* **Payment pending**—the initial order statuses.
* **Canceled**—state  of the order after it is canceled by the customer on the Storefront or by the Back Office user.
* When you select **Pay**, the state becomes **Confirmed**.
* When you select **Skip Timeout**, the state becomes **Exported**.
* When you select **Cancel**, the state becomes **Cancelled**.
* When you select **invoice-generate**, the state becomes **Exported**.
* When you select **Ship**, the state becomes **Shipped**.
* When you select **Stock-update**, the state becomes **Delivered**.
* When you select **Close**, the state becomes closed.
* In case the customer returns the ordered items: when you select **Return**, the status becomes returned.
* In case of a return, when you select **Refund**, the status becomes refunded.

## Creating returns

If a sales order item is[ returnable](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/return-management-feature-overview/return-management-feature-overview.html), you can create a return for it. Keep in mind that you can create returns for both the registered and guest users. Creating a return from the Back Office is the only way for the *guest users* to return an order.

If a sales order item is[ returnable](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/return-management-feature-overview/return-management-feature-overview.html), you can create a return for it. Keep in mind that you can create returns for both the registered and guest users. Creating a return from the Back Office is the only way for the *guest users* to return an order.


To create a return:

1. On the *View Order: [Order ID]* page, click **Return** in the top right corner. This opens the *Create Return* page.
2. On the *Create Return* page, select the items you want to return and optionally the return reason for the items.

For a [Configurable Bundle](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/configurable-bundle-feature-overview.html), you can’t select to return an entire Configurable Bundle, but you can select to return separate items from it.
The [Product Bundles](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-bundles-feature-overview.html), on the contrary, are handled as one product, so only the whole bundle can be returned. You can not return individual items of a Product Bundle.

{% endinfo_block %}

3. Click **Create return**. This creates the return and takes you to the *Overview of Return* *[Return reference]* page, where you can change the return states.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

You can create returns for the items that are in *Exported* or *Delivered* states only.

{% endinfo_block %}
