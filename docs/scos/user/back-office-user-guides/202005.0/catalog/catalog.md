The **Catalog** section in the Back Office is mostly used by the team members involved in Product Management.
It is used by:
* Product Catalog Manager in the **Products**, **Category**, **Attributes**, **Availability**, **Product Options**, **Product Lists**, **Product Barcodes**, and **Scheduled Prices** sections in the Back Office.
* Customer Service in the **Product Reviews** section in the Back Office.
