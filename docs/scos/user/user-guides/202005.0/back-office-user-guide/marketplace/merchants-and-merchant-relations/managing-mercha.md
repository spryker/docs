This topic describes how to manage merchant records.

To start working with merchants, go to **Marketplace > Merchants**.
***
## Creating a Merchant 
To create a merchant:
1. On the **Overview of Merchants** page, click **Add Merchant** in the top right corner of the page.
2. On the **Create Merchant** page, enter a name of the merchant and click **Save**.

That's it. Now you have the merchant created.

In a non-marketplace environment, the Merchant record is the record of the company which sells goods and is the only one in the system. 

## Editing a Merchant
To edit a merchant: 
1. On the **Overview of Merchants** page, you click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column for a specific merchant.
2. On the **Edit Merchant** page, change the merchant name and click **Save**.

## Deleting a Merchant
To delete a Merchant, click **Delete** in the _Actions_ column of the **Overview of Merchant** page.

This action cannot be undone and will erase all the merchant relations and other merchant-specific setups (like prices per merchant relations).
***
**What's next?**
Once you have the merchant record available in the system, you can proceed with creating a merchant relation.

See [Managing Merchant Relations](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/managing-merchant-relations) to know how you create those.
