## Creating a Return
If a sales order item is[ returnable](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/return-management-feature-overview), you can create a return for it.

To create a return:

For a [Configurable Bundle](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/configurable-bundle-feature-overview), you canâ€™t select to return an entire Configurable Bundle, but you can select to return separate items from it.
The [Product Bundles](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/product-bundle), on the contrary, are handled as one product, so only the whole bundle can be returned. You can not return individual items of a Product Bundle.

{% endinfo_block %}

3. Click **Create return**. This creates the return and takes you to the *Overview of Return* *[Return reference]* page, where you can change the return states. See [Return Item States: Reference Information](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/return-item-states-reference-information) for details on the return states you can trigger.

You can create returns for the items that are in *Exported* or *Delivered* states only.
