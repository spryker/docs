The **Threshold** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Spryker Admins.
When doing business online, there comes a time when you need to set a minimum order amount to ensure that the cost of shipping the order is worthwhile for the business. This minimum order amount is configured in the **Administration > Threshold** section.


{% info_block infoBox %}
The minimum order value can be used for both B2B and B2C businesses. The difference is that the thresholds in the B2B environment can be set up for a specific merchant relation, while in the B2C world this option is not used.
{% endinfo_block %}

Thresholds can be hard and soft, based on merchant relationships, applied globally. In case the hard threshold is configured, a buyer cannot proceed to the checkout if the buyer's cart value is below the minimum order value specified in that threshold. With a soft threshold, a customer still can proceed to the checkout, but a warning message or an additional fee can be added to the order sum as a penalty.
