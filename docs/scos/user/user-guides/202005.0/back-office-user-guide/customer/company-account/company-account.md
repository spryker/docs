The Company Account section is designed to manage the company structure and is mostly used by Sales people in cooperation with Spryker Admins that provides the details of the signed contracts.

The company accounts can be set up either in the Storefront by the company representatives or in the Back Office. The data is synchronized and the same structure is displayed in both places.

The Company Account section consists of the sections that are logically connected to each other. So the setup flow looks the following:
* **Companies** - create a company record
* **Company Units** - set up company units by assigning them to the company
* **Company Unit Addresses** - set up the company unit addresses and assign them to the company units
* **Company Roles** - create company user roles to use them when creating users
* **Company Users** - create company users and assign them to appropriate business units

**What's next?**
Let's say that you have received contract details according to which you need to set up the company infrastructure.

Some setup that you do now (creating a company record
{% endinfo_block %} is going to be used when creating Merchant relations.)

So you need to know how the company infrastructure is being set up.
See the following articles and follow the procedures described there to set up a company account:
* [Managing Companies](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/managing-companies)
