To edit a product label:
1. Click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column of the **Overview of Product Labels** page. 
2. On the **Edit Product Label** page, edit the values. See [Product Labels: Reference Information](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/product-labels-reference-information).
3. Once done, click **Save**.

## Activating/Deactivating a Product Label
