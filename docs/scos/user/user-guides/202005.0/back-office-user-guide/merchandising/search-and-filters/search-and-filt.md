The **Search and Filters** section in the Back Office is designed to build a successful user journey in finding the right product to buy. It is mostly used by Product Catalog Managers.


An essential part of organizing products in a store is to arrange items into categories. Category Filters allow you to refine and customize the way filters are listed when you search by category. With Category Filters, you can improve and optimize how visitors to the store locate products.

When a category holds a relatively small amount of products it is easy to simply scroll to locate an item. However, when the volume of products per category grows to be a long list spanning several pages, it is unreasonable to expect that a customer would stay and look at hundreds of items.

Customizing category filters is how you use your unique knowledge of your products and consumer behavior to influence and improve your customer's user experience by:
* Making products easier to locate
* Selectively removing unnecessary filters from categories
* Prioritizing the display of filters for specific categories

**What's next?**
There is no defined flow for working with search and filters. The most important to remember that if you create a new product attribute for a product and want your category to be filtered by it, and allow searching by this element, you should:
1. Create filter preferences based on the product attribute key.
2. Update the folder order, if needed.
3. Update the category filters.
4. Set up the search preference.
