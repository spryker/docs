## Creating a Quote Request
To create a new RFQ:

1. On the **Customer Account > Shopping Carts** page, select a cart you want to request a quote for.
2. On the **Cart** page, click **Request a Quote**.

3. (Optional): On the **Create Quote Request** page, populate the following fields:
    * Enter a **purchase order number**.
    * Select a due date in the **Do not ship later than** field.
    * Add the **notes**.

4. On the **Create Quote Request** page, click **Submit Request**. This will create a Request for Quote in the Draft status in the **Customer Account > Quote Request** section.

* See [Buyer Workflow](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/quotation-process-rfq-feature-overview-201907#buyer-workflow) for more information on the request statuses and the workflow.
* See [Reference Information](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/rfq-reference-information-shop-guide) for details on UI elements in the **Quote Requests** page in the Customer Account.

**What's next?**

The Quote Request is created in your Customer Account. Next, you can do the following:

1. Edit the Quote Request by adding/updating a delivery address and a shipment method, changing the number of products, measurement units etc. or providing more details (like purchase number, preferred shipment dates and adding comments) on the request.
2. Send the quote to the Sales Representative to negotiate the price.
3. Cancel the Quote Request, if you created it by mistake or don't need it anymore etc.

See [Managing RFQs](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/managing-rfqs-for-buyer-shop-guide) to learn how you can perform these actions.
