If you are not satisfied with the order items received from the seller or don’t need the items anymore, and the items are [returnable](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/return-management-feature-overview) according to the Return Policy, you can return them. 

To return items from your order:

1. Go to *My Account > Order History*. 
2. Click the return arrow next to the order you want to return. This takes you to the *Create Return* page.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

You can also access the *Create Return* page from the *Order Details* page. To access the *Order Details* page, go to  *My Account > Order History* and click **View Order**. Clicking **Create Return** in the top right corner of the *Order Details* page takes you to the *Create Return* page.

{% endinfo_block %}

3. Select the item(s) you want to return and, optionally, a reason for the return.
{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

For a [Configurable Bundle](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/configurable-bundle-feature-overview), you can’t select to return an entire Configurable Bundle, but you can select to return separate items from it.
The [Product Bundles](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/product-bundle), on the contrary, are handled as one product, so only the whole bundle can be returned. You can not return individual items of a Product Bundle.

{% endinfo_block %}

4. Click **Create Return**. This takes you to the *Return Details* page which contains all the information on your return.
