**To view the order details:**

2. On the **Order Details** page, you can see the following information:

* Order ID
* Date when the order was placed

## Sorting and Filtering Orders (B2B Shop)
When there is a long list of orders in the Customer account, it is always a good idea to filter the orders using various parameters. To **filter the orders**:

1. In the **Search** drop-down menu select one of the provided filter parameters. See [Orders: Reference Information](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/orders-reference-information) to learn more about the filter parameters.

2. Depending on the selection from step #1, enter the search query in the next to the **Search** drop-down field.

    {% info_block infoBox "Example" %}

    You can select **Product Name** in the **Search** drop-down and enter the name of the Concrete Product in the search query in the following field.

{% endinfo_block %}

To narrow the filtered results and find a more specific order, you can proceed with filtering options:

3. [Optional] Select the date range in fields **From** and **To**.

4. [Optional] In the **Business Unit** drop-down field, select the Business Unit the orders of which you would like to check. See [Company Roles: Reference Information](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/company-roles-reference-information) for the permissions needed to be assigned for viewing the Business Unit orders.

5. [Optional] Check **Show products in search results** checkmark if you wish to see the products matching your search parameters in the search results. Otherwise, only the order list appropriate to the search parameters will be displayed.

6. Click **Apply** to see the results.
