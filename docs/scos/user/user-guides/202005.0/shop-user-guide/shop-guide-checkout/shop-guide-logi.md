{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

This step appears only in case if you are not logged in to shop. Otherwise, you turn out at the [Address step](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/address-step-shop-guide-201911) at once.

If you are not logged in to shop when completing the checkout, the first page you are taken to is **Login**. At this page, you can select either of the three options:

* *Sign Up*. This option means that you can create an account and enjoy all the benefits of registered user, like saving your carts for later, adding items to wishilst, managing your orders, etc. 
* *Buy as Guest*. This option means that you can place an order as a guest user, without logging in or creating an account.
* *Login*. This option means that if you already have an account with the shop, you can log in.
