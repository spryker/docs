Configurable Bundle is a product that can be composed of individual items chosen by a customer. For example, in a shop selling custom furniture, a customer can buy a desk and add a suitable monitor stand, keyboard tray, etc. to it.

Since not all products are compatible with each other, a Spryker Administrator can set up specific rules that should be followed when a customer chooses products for a configurable bundle. These rules are defined in the configurable bundle templates, in the **Configurable Bundle Templates** section.
