CMS page is an extra HTML page of your Spryker shop that you, as a Back Office user, can create and edit using the WYSIWYG editor. The examples of CMS pages are About Us, Impressum, Terms and Conditions pages. 

You can create, view, publish and edit CMS pages in the **Pages** section. It is possible to create several versions of the same page: keep new changes or discard them and, thus, return to any previous version using the Versioning History functionality. Additionally, you can define how long the page will be visible on the store website.
