The **Administration** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Spryker Admins.

This section is designed to reflect data about stores and warehouses configuration. It is a source of information for management that helps to either approve the configuration or identify the need for updates.

This is how the data about stores and warehouses is communicated between different teams inside and outside of Spryker Back Office.

This section was designed as a reference location. Thus, no actual actions can be performed there. It is utilized as a quick overview of existing stores and warehouses.
