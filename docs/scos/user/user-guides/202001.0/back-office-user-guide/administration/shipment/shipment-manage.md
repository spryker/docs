The Shipment section of the Spryker Back Office is mostly used by E-Commerce managers. 
The carrier companies that you want to have integrated into the shop can be configured from the Back Office. For each carrier company, you can add one or more shipment methods that you want to enable in the shop.
A carrier company refers to a company that provides shipment services (for example, DHL, UPS, etc.) A carrier company can have one or more shipment services associated (for example, Express Delivery, Standard Delivery).
