The main focus of content items is to work on the content and its placement separately. Thus, first, you create content and then decide where to insert it.

This section is designed to create and edit content items that are a new abstraction layer for any content, such as image, text, product list, video, word or pdf files. After you create content items, you can add them to multiple placeholders of blocks or pages using a content item widget coupled with its template.

{% info_block warningBox %}
You can work with content items after they have been installed for your project.
{% endinfo_block %}

In the Back Office, you can create the following content items:

* Banner
* Abstract Product List that by default includes its Product Groups
* Product Set 
* File List
