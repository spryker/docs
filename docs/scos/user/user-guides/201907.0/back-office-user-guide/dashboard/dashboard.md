The **Dashboard** section in Back Office is mostly used by E-Commerce Managers. 
This section is used to provide analytical data to management so that they can build the KPI-based plans and report to investors and other interest groups on daily, weekly, or monthly basis. 
**Standardized flow of actions for a Spryker Admin**

{% info_block infoBox %}
This is how the Dashboard data is communicated inside and outside of Spryker Back Office.

This section was designed as a reference location. Thus, no actual actions can be performed there. This is utilized as a quick overview of basic order-related statistics.
