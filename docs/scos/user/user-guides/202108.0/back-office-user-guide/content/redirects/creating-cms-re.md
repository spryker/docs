This topic provides a list of steps to create a redirect in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

To start working with the CMS redirects, navigate to the **Content** > **Redirects** section.

Review the reference information before you start, or just look up the necessary information as you go through the process.


## Creating a CMS redirect

To create a CMS redirect:
1. On the *CMS Redirect* page, click **Add CMS Redirect** in the top right corner of the page.
2. On the *Add a CMS Redirect* page that opens, enter the following details:
    * **Url**: Specify a URL from which you want to create a redirect link.
    * **To URL**: Add a URL that you want your existing URL to be redirected to.
    * **Redirect status code**: Select a status code from the drop-down list. 
3. To keep the changes, click **Save**. This will take you to the list of CMS redirects pages where you can find a new redirect URL.

On the *Add a CMS Redirect* page, you can return to the list of redirects by clicking **Back to CMS** in the top right corner of the page.

## Reference information: Creating a CMS redirect

On the *CMS Redirect* page, you see the following:

| ATTRIBUTE | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| ID | Redirect identifier. |
|From Url  | URL from which a new URL destination will be configured. |
| To Url | New URL destination. |
| Status | Redirect status code. |
| Actions | Set of actions that will be performed on a redirect. |

On the *CMS Redirects* page, you can also:

* Switch to the page where you can create a new redirect.
* Sort content items by *ID* and *From Url*.
* Filter content items by *ID*, *From Url*, *To Url*, and *Status*.

#### What's next?
The redirect URL has been created. However, you can either edit it or delete.

* To learn how to edit and/or delete a redirect, see [Managing CMS redirects](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-cms-redirects).
