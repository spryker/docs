The *File List* section is a way to quickly review all the files from the file tree.

## Prerequisites

In the *File List* section, you can do the actual managing action only in case you already have the files in the file tree.

To start working with the file list, navigate to **File Manager** > **File List**.

## Viewing a file

To view a file:

1. On the *File List* page in the _Actions_ column, click **View**.
2. On the *View File* page, you see the version, file name, the date and time when the file was uploaded.

**Tips & tricks**
On this page, you can download the file:
1. Click **Download** in the _Actions_ column.
2. Follow the download pop-up instructions.

## Editing a file
To edit a file:
1. On the *File List* page in the _Actions_ column, click **Edit**.
2. On the *Edit File* page, update the attributes.
3. Click **Save**.

On the *Edit File* page, an additional tab name *File versions* appears.

The *File versions* tab shows the version of the file. 
* A new version is created if you download a new file instead of the one already used. 
* If you only update the attributes, no new version is created.

**Tips & tricks**
In the *File versions* tab, you can manage the versions by:
* Removing the not needed versions. Click **Delete** in the _Actions_ column for the version you want to remove.
* Downloading a specific version by clicking **Download**.

## Deleting a file
If the file is no longer needed, you can permanently delete it from the system.

To delete a file, in the _Actions_ column, click **Delete** for a file you want to remove.
