Checkout allows purchasing the items added to the cart.

If you have several shopping carts in your account, choose the right one and proceed with the checkout. See [Shop Guide - Shopping Carts](https://documentation.spryker.com/v1/docs/shop-guide-shopping-carts

* [Shipment](/docs/scos/dev/user-guides/201811.0/shop-user-guide/checkout/shipment-step-s): Select a shipment method and/or a delivery date.
* [Payment](/docs/scos/dev/user-guides/201811.0/shop-user-guide/checkout/payment-step-sh): Select the payment method.
* [Summary](/docs/scos/dev/user-guides/201811.0/shop-user-guide/checkout/summary-step-sh): View the details, update the information, if needed, and place the order.
