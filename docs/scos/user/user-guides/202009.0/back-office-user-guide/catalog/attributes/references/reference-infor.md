This document describes the reference information for managing product attributes, and provides examples of regular and super product attributes.

On the *Attributes* page, you see the following information:
* Autogenerated attribute ID.
* Attribute key.
* An identifier that shows if an attribute is a super attribute: *true* stand for a *super attribute*, and *false* stands for a regular attribute.
* Attribute type
* Attribute actions.
***
The following table describes the attributes you enter and select on the *Create a Product Attribute* page.

| Attribute |Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Attribute Key** |  Name of the attribute you create, for example, `color`. |
| **Input type** | Defines the data format of the of the attribute value. |
| **Super attribute** | Defined if the product attribute is a [super attribute](). Super attributes distinguish concrete products of an abstract product.  |
| **Predefined values** | The values for you attribute, e.g. if the attribute you create is a **color**, the values for it can be _red_, _green_, _black_, etc. |
| **Allow input any value other than predefined ones** | A checkbox that defines whether you can enter the values other than the predefined ones when creating or updating a product variant. |
| **Translation** | The translation for either an attribute key into the other language based on the locales for which you add the translation.|
| **Translate predefined values** | A checkbox that defines if the predefined values will also be translated. If selected, the predefined value itself and the **Translation** field for it appears. |

The super attributes are displayed in the Variants tab of the **Create a Product** page of an abstract product.
