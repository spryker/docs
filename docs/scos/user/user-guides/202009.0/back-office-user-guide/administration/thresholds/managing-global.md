    * [Setting up a Hard Minimum Threshold](#setting-up-a-hard-minimum-threshold)

**Tips & Tricks**

In the **Message** field, enter *{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}threshold{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}* or *{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}fee{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}* to reference the threshold name or the defined fee, respectively. When the message is rendered on the Storefront, the placeholders are replaced with the values from **Enter threshold value** and **Enter flexible fee** or **Enter fixed fee** fields.
