CMS widget is a content snippet you can add and edit in the WYSIWYG editor. As a shop administrator, you can use them to display charts, product lists, or product groups to be shown on one or more pages. 

With CMS widgets, you can display the page content that can be, for instance, adjustable to some specific marketing events or insert media files to be downloaded by your site visitors.
