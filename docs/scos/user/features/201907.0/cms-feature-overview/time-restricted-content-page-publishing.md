The validity period is defined in the Back Office.

Marketing teams and e-commerce managers can define the time limits for a specific CMS Page during which it can be viewed by the shop visitors.

Let's say your shop needs to have a limited promotional offer for green t-shirts for a Saint Patrick's Day. In the **Back Office -> Pages** section, you will create a CMS page for this specific date range, making the promotion visible starting one week before the holiday (**Valid from** date) and ending the week after the holiday (**Valid to** date). So the page will be available only for several weeks.

Once the defined **Valid to** date ends, the page will be automatically hidden from your storefront.
