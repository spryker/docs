You might wonder how we manage escalations. Let's start with how we define escalations at Spryker.

## What is an Escalation?
An escalation is a situation that usually involves a partner or customer having an urgent or especially important problem that cannot immediately be solved to the satisfaction of everyone involved and the problem is "escalated" to senior leadership or other departments in an effort to resolve the problem.

Example for a situation leading up to an escalation:
Customer A discovers a problem with Spryker that has a significant impact on their plans to launch a new feature next week. They open a support case with Spryker. The support representative dealing with the case informs the customer that they have verified that the bug is indeed a bug and a report was filed with development to fix the bug. The mention that the bug will most likely be fixed within 3-4 weeks. This will conflict with the customer's feature release.

While support will always try to accommodate the plans of customers and partners, this might not always be possible. Naturally, this leads to frustration and Company A might feel the need to reach out to their Account Manager/Partner Manager/Customer Success Manager, or even a member of Spryker leadership to "force" or at least expedite problem resolution that way. 

While this strategy might feel like the right thing to do (we need to do something right?) it produces suboptimal results, at it consumes resources, nerves, and time. It also puts a strain on the relationship with the customer/partner and often introduces a great deal of emotions that can stand in the way of orderly resolution.

## How do we want to deal with Escalations?
In Support, we acknowledge that we cannot always produce a satisfying result. We do not always get it right and sometimes our hands might simply be tied. Escalations will happen and it is important for us to steer them into a constructive and orderly direction right away that ensures:
1. It is easy for a customer/partner to escalate an issue.
2. The customer/partner's problem is evaluated by the right audience.
3. The stakeholders align quickly to find a feasible strategy going forward.

### How can I initiate an escalation?
There are two ways to initiate an escalation:
1. Creating an [Emergency Case](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/how-to-use-the-support-portal#emergencies) always start an escalation. You will receive an Email notifying you that an Escalation was started.
2. Every email that our support representatives send out includes and "Escalate Case" Link. You will also find an "Escalate Support Case" button on the top right corner of the detail case view on the[ Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com). This link will open a form that you can use to describe why you want to escalate this case. The issue will then be evaluated by internal stakeholders in Spryker and we will get in touch with you within 24h (working hours) to resolve the issue blocking the orderly processing of your case.

### When can I initiate an escalation?
If you feel that your issue is not receiving the attention it deserves, or if you feel you are getting "stuck" and you have already tried to resolve the situation with your support representative directly unsuccessfully, you can make use of this option. 

### What we ask from you
This is a powerful way to bring your issue to the attention of a broad audience. We ask you to not misuse this option to expedite regular bug resolution or case processing. It will make several people in Spryker very busy and might therefore even have the opposite effect.
