**PHP 7.3** is supported until the end of August 2021. Therefore, we strongly recommend switching to **PHP 7.4+** until then.

We plan to start supporting **PHP 8.0** during 2021 and keep supporting **PHP 7.4** until the end of October 2022.

The following graph shows the timelines of support of different PHP versions.
