## PHP 7

Since April 2022, Spryker requires PHP 7.4 as the minimum version. We will keep supporting PHP 7.4 until June 2022.

## PHP 8

Since October 2021, Spryker has been compatible with PHP 8.0. We recommend using PHP 8.0, if possible. 
We plan to introduce PHP 8.1 support by the end of June 2022. However, using this version remains optional for now.
