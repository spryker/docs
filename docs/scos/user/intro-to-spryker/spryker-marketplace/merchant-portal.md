The Merchant Portal is a section from the Back office for the [Marketplace merchants](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/{{site.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview.html). It is based on Zed and Zed UI Framework, and provides the interface for Merchants to conduct their business on the Marketplace. Here merchants can manage their profile, offers, products, and sales related to their company.


By default, Marketplace administrators do not have access to the Merchant Portal.

## Merchant Portal tables

In the Merchant Portal, tables are designed to fit the needs of any Merchant Portal user.
You can encounter tables in the [Offers](/docs/pbc/all/offer-management/{{site.version}}/marketplace/manage-product-offers.html), [Products](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{site.version}}/marketplace/manage-in-the-merchant-portal/abstract-products/create-marketplace-abstract-products.html), and [Orders](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{site.version}}/marketplace/manage-merchant-orders.html) sections of the Merchant Portal.
Merchant Portal tables are adjustable. You can configure the table to display only the details that you need, for example, show or hide the unnecessary columns, rearrange them or reset the table view to the default state.

### Table filters
In addition to the convenient view, tables in the Merchant Portal have handy filter view options. They let you find the relevant data much faster.
