## Features
### Attribute Management for A High Number of Attributes
To  manage a high number of product attributes, we moved them to a separate module supported with a UI.

## Improvements
### Template Validation to CMS Blocks
Previously, it was possible to create a CMS block with a template that did not exist (template file was removed). We added a CMS block template check to prevent creating CMS blocks without a valid template. Users are notified with an appropriate message when this occurs.

**Affected Modules**

| MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n/a | [CmsBlock 1.3.0](https://github.com/spryker/cms-block/releases/tag/1.3.0) | [CmsBlockGui 1.1.3](https://github.com/spryker/cms-block-gui/releases/tag/1.1.3) |

### Order Countries
Previously, the countries list was unordered. We have added sorting to the `Spryker\Zed\Country\Business\CountryManager::getCountryCollection()` method to have countries display in the alphabetical order.

**Affected Modules**

| MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
|n/a  | n/a | [Country 3.1.1](https://github.com/spryker/Country/releases/tag/3.1.1) |

### Remove Empty Catch Block
The obsolete exception catch block in the `DataImporter` was removed. This change makes location import easier and transparent (in case of an issue, it will be thrown by its initiator).

**Affected Modules**

| MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n/a | n/a | [DataImport 1.0.1](https://github.com/spryker/data-import/releases/tag/1.0.1) |

### Customer Group Optimisation
Previously, when creating a customer group, if there were many customers the browser would hang. With this release, a special UI was introduced to the `CustomerGroup` module. It allows you to seamlessly manage a high amount of customers and customer group relations.

**Affected Modules**

| MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
|n/a  | [CustomerGroup 2.2.0](https://github.com/spryker/customer-group/releases/tag/2.2.0) | n/a |

### Cache for Navigation
To improve navigation performance, we added a cache to the `Navigation` module.

**Affected Modules**

| MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n/a | n/a | [Navigation 1.0.2](https://github.com/spryker/Navigation/releases/tag/1.0.2) |

## Bugfixes
### Product Availability with Numeric SKUs
Previously, the availability of concrete products with numerical SKUs was incorrectly mapped. Due to this, the cart availability check did not  behave as expected, resulting in product variants not being available. This issue has been fixed.

**Affected Modules**

| MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n/a | n/a | [CartVariant 1.0.1](https://github.com/spryker/cart-variant/releases/tag/1.0.1) |

### Category Removal
When a category is deleted, the deleted category's children are moved under the deleted category's parent. Previously, the category removal in Zed Admin UI could not handle a case when one of the children of the deleted category was also under the parent of deleted category. This issue is fixed now. The removal will move all children nodes of a deleted category under the parent. If one or more of the moved categories are already under the new parent, they will be ignored. The same rule will be applied for its children in case of collision.

| n/a | [Category 4.1.0](https://github.com/spryker/Category/releases/tag/4.1.0) | n/a |

| --- | --- | --- |
| n/a | n/a | [Acl 3.0.2](https://github.com/spryker/Acl/releases/tag/3.0.2) |

### Sort Product Assignment Tables in Category
Previously, you could not sort the table of assignable or already assigned products within a category-product assignment in Zed Admin UI. This was fixed by adding sorting options. The Assignable Product table now by default sorts by ascending ID sorting and allows ID, SKU re-sorting. The Already Assigned product table, now by default sorts by ascending "Order" and allows ID, SKU, "Order" re-sorting.
