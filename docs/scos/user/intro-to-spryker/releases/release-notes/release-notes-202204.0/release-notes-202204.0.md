## Spryker Commerce OS

This section describes the new features released for Spryker Commerce OS.

### Cart and Checkout

Inside the cart and checkout endpoints, we have added information about the minimal, soft, and hard thresholds defined in your Spryker project.

#### Documentation

### Discount priority

For cases when several non-exclusive discounts apply to a customer’s cart, a Back Office user can set discount priorities to define the order in which discounts are applied and calculated.

![discount-priority](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202204.0/release-notes-202204.0.md/discount-priority.png)

#### Documentation

[Discount priority](/docs/pbc/all/discount-management/discount-management.html#discount-priority)

### Category-based discounts

We have added `category` to the list of fields for discount conditions and calculation. A Back Office user can now use categories and subcategories to define when or to what products a discount should be applied.

![category-based-discounts](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202204.0/release-notes-202204.0.md/category-based-discounts.png)

#### Documentation

[Decision rule](/docs/pbc/all/discount-management/discount-management.html#decision-rule)

### Time-defined discount validity

Discount validity now supports HH:MM time in addition to dates. For example, a voucher can be redeemed, or a discount applies to the cart starting from 01.12.2021 23:00 until 31.01.2022 22:59, UTC.

![time-defined-discount-validity](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202204.0/release-notes-202204.0.md/time-defined-discount-validity.png)

#### Documentation

[Discount validity interval](/docs/pbc/all/discount-management/discount-management.html#discount-validity-interval)

### Strikethrough prices on promotional products

When the **Cart** page shows eligible promotional products, these products now show the discounted price with a strikethrough default price. This improves the customer experience by showing the discount a customer can receive if they add a product to the cart.

![strikethrough-prices-on-promotional-products](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202204.0/release-notes-202204.0.md/strikethrough-prices-on-promotional-products.png)

#### Documentation

[Promotions & Discounts feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/discount-management/discount-management.html)


### Multiple abstract products within a promotional product discount

Promotional product discounts can now designate more than one abstract SKU as the promotional product. Back Office users can enter as many abstract SKUs as they want into the discount creation form, and customers will see all eligible products in a carousel below the products in their cart.

![multiple-abstract-products-within-a-promotional-product-discount](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202204.0/release-notes-202204.0.md/multiple-abstract-products-within-a-promotional-product-discount.png)

### Storefront

Wherever a number is displayed, it corresponds to the current locale of the session of the guest or customer.

### Back-Office

Wherever a number is displayed, it corresponds to the current locale of the user’s session.

### Ecosystem

#### Computop

##### PayU (Poland)

Through Computop, you can now use the PayU set of payment services. This capability is only available in Poland.

##### PayPal Express

With PayPal Express, your customers can complete transactions in just a few steps using their shipping and billing information already stored securely at PayPal to check out, so they don’t have to re-enter it. When PayPal Express is configured with the default settings, customers must have a PayPal account to complete payment.

#### Documentation
[Installing and configuring Computop](/docs/scos/dev/technology-partner-guides/202204.0/payment-partners/computop/installing-and-configuring-computop.html)

#### Payone

##### Klarna

Use Klarna services to let your customers pay later for their purchases.

## PaaS+

Starting from this version, B2C and B2B Demo Shops are fully compatible with the industry and our own coding standards. The implemented fixes are based on the evaluation performed by the Evaluator tool.

You can now evaluate your code and make sure it’s upgradable by following the [Keeping a project upgradable](/docs/scos/dev/guidelines/keeping-a-project-upgradable/keeping-a-project-upgradable.html) guide. After a successful evaluation, headless projects can safely take minor and patch updates. For PaaS+ projects, if a project passes the evaluation, the updates are provided automatically.

## ACP (APP Composition Platform)

This version fully supports ACP. Details on ACP will be shared later.

## Technical enhancements

### Authorization strategy and implementation across availability notifications, carts, and addresses

We have implemented authorization strategy plugins using `AuthorizationStrategyPluginInterface` that can be identified by a name they define for themselves. These names can be used in resource routes implementing the `AuthorizationStrategyAwareResourceRoutePluginInterface` or at least the `DefaultAuthorizationStrategyAwareResourceRoutePluginInterface`. This lets us map a specific strategy to a resource and HTTP verb. The new authorization module puts these plugins into a collection from where they can be retrieved by name.

The `GlueApplicationAuthorization` module extracts the required information for an authorization request from the incoming HTTP request via the `AuthorizationRestUserValidatorPlugin` plugin. It passes the extracted data to the authorization mechanism using the authorization client.

![generic-authorization-strategy-concept](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202204.0/release-notes-202204.0.md/generic-authorization-strategy-concept.png)

## Export table views

Users can now export the data from the tables of the Back Office or the Merchant Portal. Users can export the fields of the Back Office tables into a CSV file using the **Export** button.
The developers, in their turn, can enable a business user to export a table view by assigning an exporting functionality (for example, plugin or trait) to a Table Query container or Repository.

## PHP compatibility window

As we have previously communicated, we are deprecating PHP 7.3 compatibility to maintain a “healthy” support window on the [allowed PHP versions](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/whats-new/supported-versions-of-php.html). We continue to work on the upcoming versions, and we have solved some bugs that were blocking full PHP 8.0 compatibility. Our main focus is on 8.1 preparation, especially on Propel library support.

## Symfony compatibility window

We have also made Symfony 5.4 compatible while preparing to support compatibility with Symfony 6. Our compatibility window deprecates Symfony 3, as three versions are maintained.
With the knowledge of 6.0 changes, we can now make our code 5.4 compatible with minimal BC breaks while already planning future 6.0 support for the next year.

#### Documentation
[Integrating Symfony 5](/docs/scos/dev/technical-enhancement-integration-guides/integrating-symfony-5.html)

## Performance upgrades

We have enhanced several points where performance has been improved to allow for a faster page load and better throughput. The main changes include:

* Upselling products, previously loaded synchronously, are now be loaded via AJAX.
* Cart items are also loaded into the cart using the AJAX calls.
* Checking availability for all the current SKUs at once instead of one by one.
* On the **Cart** page, we do a Zed call to validate the quote. Inside of that, previously, some queries were executed more than once.
* Gateway and ZedRestApi do not use the same resources as a "normal" Zed request; separating those reduces the required ApplicationPlugins and improves performance.
* Pagination enhancement.

## General bug fixes

### New Relic visibility

Navigation between Glue and Zed Gateway calls in New Relic are now visible to be able to understand the Zed Gateway trace as well as the Glue trace in the same instance of New Relic.
