## How do I start with Spryker Marketplace?

For new projects, we provide a B2C Demo Marketplace template, which is a great starting point.  The Demo Shop is a collection of B2C-specific and Marketplace features.

Even if you don't need marketplace features at first, but you are going to use them in future, the B2C Demo Marketplace is still the best starting point. You can just ignore the marketplace features until you actually want to use them.

To learn how to install B2C Demo Marketplace, see [Spryker Marketplace Setup](/docs/marketplace/dev/setup/spryker-marketplace-setup.html).
