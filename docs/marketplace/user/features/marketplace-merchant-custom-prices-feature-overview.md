The *Marketplace Merchant Custom Prices* feature allows marketplace merchants to define custom prices for the marketplace products within specific business units of B2B customers via the Merchant Portal.

A merchant can set two types of prices:

- *Default prices*. These are the prices shown by default to all regular customers.
- *Custom prices*. These are different prices meant for specific target audience.

Customers see custom prices for products based on their merchant relationship, or default prices if the merchant relationship doesn't have prices for marketplace products.
